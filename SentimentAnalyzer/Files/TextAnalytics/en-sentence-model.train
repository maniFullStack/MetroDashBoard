My all around  experience in what i got to take part in was great no complaint what ever .
Clean up bathroom and slot machines should be cleaned regularly along with people Thant eat at machines should not be allowed.
I don't want to see people eating at machines.
Not only your host walking around have security who ever they are should be wearing coats that say security that people now that there is security and in parking lot where is security.
When I was leaving I was not sure about the exit to take.
I asked a staff member and he escorted me to the exit - I thought that was very nice of him.
I already told friends and family about your awesome place and excellent staff
I really like to go there
some security persons behave like everyone is guilty rather than innocent citizens.
this I find offensive.

Need more lighting markings on the stairs for the elderly.
sometimes it's hard to find parking...
It was my first time so hard to give a fair evaulation
RESTAURANT AND PLAYER CLUB DESK ARE BOTH EXCELLENT...
YOUR RESTAURANT HAS EXCELLENT COOKS AND SERVING STAFF....
I found that the machines are very tight
I think they could have more Servers on the floor.
Several times I put my light on for service and no one came to give me change
It would be nice if you offerded the same 10.00 dollar special  that Ducan  chances offers
Do you think you can provide this service ?

The security staff as soon as he read my ID wished me happy birthday and said if I go to guest services I can receive a present.
Guest services was an amazing young woman who talked to me about her love of football and also wished me happy birthday.
These 2 incidents occuring within 5 minutes of walking in the door really made me appreciate the staff being so personal and friendly and would like to thank them for their remarkable customer service.
Thank you.
Staff is the best of any casino we have been in.
Super.
Was with a friend that had a $10 voucher but staff (young lady) couldn't process it.
So after what seemed like 10 minutes.
She called a supervisor over and after several minutes he finally told her to issue a slot voucher.
After getting to machine it asked my friend for password so back to customer service to get password issued.

Must say staff was friendly and polite but the $10 voucher not worth the wait
The Night Market has killed the Casino on the weekends.
Every one is great I get treated like a king
Would have been top marks but website advertised slot machine that was not available at this location.
It was playboy party
The sides of some of the slot machines, where you would put a drink down were quite dirty and sticky.
More than just one or two drinks prior to mine being put there.
Stains and stickiness.
Also some of the keys on the slot machines were sticky.
And some of the keys, the repeat bet button does not work, so you would have to get pressing the bet button, just a little more off then the repeat button.

Also some of the copper garbage cans on the floor were dirty, the outside, there were clean bags inside, but you could tell the outside of the can had not been washed in some time.
Think some things needed a scrub down and make them shine again, like they always seemed to be prior to this visit.
I  have been bring 4 people to the casino every week and we drop about $800.00 a month there.
We have also gone to the Moncton casino overnight and have a very good experience there.
They have $5.00.,10.00 LUNCH AND SUPPER specials that are so much better than C
Great casino.
I can only repeat that all of the staff with whom I had contact were extremely pleasant and helpful.
I never encountered any staff other than security on my way in.
really enjoy coming to Nanaimo Casino .
Lots of variety in the machines.

Staff are all very pleasant and helpful.
Would be nice to have a drink while you play
I would like whales of cash penny slot back!
Food court not up to par.
Also needs to be cleaner.
Sorry.
Would be nice if the slot machines paid like they USED to!
wish the mashines would pay better
Improve outside building facade.
would be nice to have a self serve coffee/tea area at the back

They always seem very friendly and approachable
There should be a separate person on weekends doing coat check.
Had to wait over 15 minutes on Friday & Saturday night just to check my coat in.
Very inconvenient.
Would only be necessary on weekends.
I do not get a friendly welcome when I walk through the door.
I play a lot on the games on the "upstairs" room and wish there was a coffee/tea service there.
Most of the staff are nice and friendly
I hope that my comments will be taken seriously, but time will tell.
I just do not understand why the staff and the "men in suits" cannot at least acknowledge that there are customers on the floor.

Heavens people this is Halifax we have always been known for our "friendliness"
Staff in the lounge in casino were excellent
Overall a very well run establishment on all accounts
I think I should not pay for the $16.00 parking to play at the Racecourse..
Thank You...
Love the memorobilia
parking is an issue when there are events having to pay $20.00 to park we will go to another casino unless parking fee is refunded as it is at edgewater
It was my first and only visit to the Casino and I participated in the Casino Virgin Academy.
The staff were excellent - from checking in through each of the dealers/specialists who helped us learn - everybody made it a fun experience!
Get rid of the skunks near the entrance!

 Stand with free coffee and tea would be appreciated.
All the good slot machines have disappeared.
Also when you need help at a machine it is impossible to find someone
Just a time
never seen coffee server last few visits didn't think you had them anymore.
Thio s is the only casino in Metro Vancouver that requires pay parking.
Now with PNE not only pay paarking but also admission fee through PNE gates.
Way too costly!!!!!
$10.00 parking is way too costly to start with.
Exactly what programs do you offer to compensate parking if any & please be very specific in detail.

I am reluctant to return when all other casino's basically have the same ammenities with no parking fee or gate admission fee.
I would have to say that River Rock Team has always made my outing a great experience.
I will alway return for the games and great service from the friendly people on your team.
Thank-you!
Ms.
Jane Atkinson
they need to appease the younger clientele coming in and not just the over 60 crowd hat seems to be catered to more than anyone else.
Almost felt out of place
they are the reason I like the casino
we miss the sirens slot machines

need more Dice machines (hot shots )
I was only there a short time but I do have to say out of the 3 chances casinos Ive been to this is by far the best.
Would prefer if the piped in music were a little less LOUD!
There's enough sound coming from the machines and the happy people!!!!!
The washrooms did not seem to be cleaned often enough for the number of female patrons who seemingly do not take care!!!!!!!!!
Like the new smoking pit!!
Very friendly staff.
Most of the staff was very friendly.
Managers could be more upbeat.
I found that slot attendants were hard pressed to respond to the Service Light on a slot machine

Smoking area is around the corner and I felt unsafe.
I would instead stand on the curb because you weren't feeling safe.
would like to see paybacks more frequent to lengthen time versus money more like Nevada where playing time is longer for same amount of money
Nanaimo Casino is the only one I go to.....
with the exception if I am in the USA
Not enough cart severs poor slow service in restaurant.
In bingo we are treated poorly we come last when in comes to speed and on days when the well is slow if it was not for bingo customers they would have no sales.
It's beyond rude the prices are outrageous and the quality of food is poor it's always cold by the time it arrives.
All staff excellent
Always have a great visit.

Would like to win more but wouldn't we all.
nice to be greated at door and if they could be of help----------I am from out of town
We hsd a great time.
Guest services was excellent
I often find the coffee service is very slow.
I have often been gaming a few hours before it has been offered.
as far as staff, most look bored, a few whom I have experienced, when going to the desk do not EVEN SPEAK, this being for parking tickets, perhaps hire people who look like they are enjoying their job, no one ever approaches you
Didn't really have any connection with staff other than security greeting at the door.
While at the tables your dealers, suprevisors & pit bosses are friendly and respectful of your clients.
The cocktail servers often are not very friendly if you asking for the complimentary drinks.

Slots attendants and cashier mostly take too long
the staff was amazing Friday (may 1st) evening.
They were laughing and joking with myself and my friend.
Made the night exceptional!!!!!
9 of us ate at the buffet for our anniversary and the food was horrible!!!
A Waste of $36!
I would not tell anyone to eat there and really feel we wasted a lot of money on horrible food!
I've only been once.
Hard to judge.
You should offer soda drinks.

I don't drink coffee during the day or evening.
The Asian coffee cart server.
She is amazing so friendly and polite.
Friendly staff!
Staff I encountered friendly and cheerful
Need more staff to assist when needed.
Waiting time is just too long.
All was great.
would like follow up on injured horses and jockeysosted somewhere
My friend and I wanted to eat and drink in the lounge.

We arrived at 6:30 p.m.
There was a waiting list to get in so the hostess took my cell phone number and said she would text me when there was a table for us.
So we went to play blackjack while we waited.
At 8:00 we went back to the lounge where we could see there were empty tables.
When we asked her why had not texted me she said that she assumed that we were going to the show so she stroked us off the list when the show began.
This was very poor service as we were there primarily to visit over a meal and drinks.
Had she got us a table earlier we would have spent more time and money in the lounge and then still gone to play black jack.
As it was we had only one drink each and an appetizer.
I expect better service than that at River Rock.
the slots sure do not pay out for me ever.

Paul at the craps table is awesome remembered my wife and I from a month ago..
made room for her to play
Every thing was great.
had a bclc voucher (good anywhere) but cashier sent me to restaurant to ``validate`` so it shows casino`s retailer number which defeats the purpose of why I was asked where I bought the ticket and why I could not cash it there instead of the casino.
I feel that the video poker machines have become so tight that you are not being fair to the players for the amount of time and money we put into them.
Very busy traffic on the surrounding roads leading to the casino because of the night market near by.
Afraid to come due to the traffic jam in the road and difficultly to find parking.
Some slot attendants seem to give out a reserve sign and then never check back on it - there are a limited number of machines and if I feel reserve sign has been on a machine too long ( over 15 minutes) trying to find a slot attendant to ask is sometimes impossible.
Forget pushing "help" button - you can wait what seems like a long time before anyone comes.
Was not able to get a drink and was in the casino for over an hour.

Not enough slot attendants
Had to wait far to long to have a slot attendant fix a machine (10 minutes) Food cashier was not knowledgeable about other food services and gave incorrect information Security staff are very welcoming yet effective
when we first started coming the slots paid waaaaaaaay better now they do not pay nearly as much...
very disappointing ....
sometimes 100.00 plus into a machine without any or little return....
also you have a male that works the coffee cart and he is all but invisible..
sometimes we are there for 2plus hours and never see him.....
common complaint from a lot of my friends
I love the River Rock.
The only real complaint or feedback that I have is that the cost of a glass of red wine is very high.

I understand that you do that to deter drinking but it is nice to have a glass of wine when you play and at $10 + it is a bit steep.
When the front desk staff found out that it was our wedding anniversary they took the trouble to order us chocolate covered strawberries delivered to the room.
What a delightful surprise.
We really appreciated them going the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our special ocasion.
parking problem!
do not feel safe at all
Parking lot and finding our way to Resturant wasn't easy
I am very reluctant to return to this casino as it is the only casino that requires pay parking fees.
 All others are free & $10 is riduculous!
it was so dark i put money in the recipt slot embareasing

 The staff overall were very courteous & friendly.
Parking was excellent.
GREAT and EXCELLENT....
This was our first visit and didn't have a lot of time but we will be back.
All are very friendly and accommodating
The staff at the reception desk are friendly and helpful.
Thanks
Tony is a very good employee
need a better variety at the restaurant.
bring back your fish and chips they were great and its the only thing my husband will eat there.

Brief visit but pleasant helpful staff.
I hadn't played at the casino in years and all new  to me.
Lot's of fun!!
Staff attend to inquiries promptly and courteously.
I had a great time and I was impressed when trying to locate a slot machine the attendant knew where it was and walk3d me to ut.
The food quality in the Buffet Resturant have room to be improved.
The Greeters At The Entrance Are Usually Very Nice.
very patient and caring for customers
Casino need's better parking.
 Casino needs a face lift better decor and lighting
 
A teller at race betting counter was very rude when I made an error on request for my bet .
It was my first time here and had never made a bet on horses.
I then used machine after so I was not made to look stupid just because I didn't know race lingo don't remember name but now wish I had reported then
it is always hard to find a service attendant .............also there is a ( cleaning women ) for the machines that is not very friendly and always moody when asked any question.
Other wise the other staff is pretty good at their jobs
The server at the restaurant - Brianne - was very nice and professional.
The guest services person was incredibly helpful and friendly.
Staff always make me feel secure and that is most important to me Thanks
Not enough slot attendances
I believe the pit boss had an australian accent, I didn't catch her name, but I will likely avoid table games in the future if she is working.

Found her rude, condescending, and she did not have adequate knowledge of the games she was supervising.
She was also insulting, and I have never felt more humiliated in a conversation with a pit boss like I did there.
Rude.
Rude.
RUDE.
Cashier at the buffet restaurant was okay
came by bus from local hotel
Peter the bartender has a very positive attitude.
Very friendly and genuine.
He took the time to bring me a pina colada directly to my seat.

I was impressed as this was not a drink he could make at his station.
I was a great experience.
Love the new casino.
I did not really have any interaction with staff on my last visit.
Generally I would say when I do have contact with staff they are friendly and polite.
Although I know it was during the pne I didn't like how we had to pay 16 each to get into the track.
Would have prefered to spend the money at the track or casino
KENO MACHINE  and TV Scrren IS NOT WORKING ALL THE TIME/
I m missing Poker Rum.
over all the experience was good with the exception of parking during the night market.

Traffic control people seemed to be very disorganized it took over an hour to exit the casino parking lot
The dealers chat a lot in Chinese with the players and some so us feel left out.
no comment
am looking forward to moving to the new facility when it is built - more machines are needed especially after the bingo hours  - there are times when there is a long lineup at the cashiers cage - the floor attendants take a lot of time to fill out payouts at the cashier desk - I must say that 99% of the employees are very personable.
the slot machine music is overpowering.
I was there and not a bad place but small and not too much selection of machines and parking a bit hairy getting in and out from Main Street cause people waiting for spot at entrance and line of cars on main road also I found the slot attendant a bit rude when I asked where the ATM was her response was ..
Right there where is says ATM the way she said it was very rude I mean obviously I didn't see where it was but made me feel stupid ..
My vision is not the best even with the big letters and feel she should have just pointed out the direction politely
Can't wait to came back for more fun & hopefully win the $100 gift card.
The Staff members and Supervisors are really nice and friendly

Enjoyed my experience everytime I am there.
It's all good.
I waited a good ten or more minutes for a slot attendant to arrive when my machine "seized-up".
even then I had to Flag a "PASSING ATTENDANT" myself !
I had even turned on the SERVICE MACHINE LIGHT on machines on either side of me to ATTRACT ATTENTION...BUT STILL NO ATTENDANT ARRIVED !!
I ate at the "BIG O" burger bar.
I ordered a hamburger...was given a ticket to pay and to retrieve my burger when called !
I waited and waited...at least 15 minutes...people around me were getting their food...but not me...OH NO !!!!
Finally I went to the counter and asked the lady who had taken my order...as to WHERE IS MY BURGER !!!
She went to the other end of the counter and found my simple order ???

Don't you deliver to the table I was sitting at OR at least call my number...there wasn't that many patrons (except I guess the 10 or so girls that I presume where there for "THE PRICE IS RIGHT" !!)When I got to the register cashier to pay for my burger...the man ahead of me took out a big bag of change for his pocket and asked the cashier to give him paper money.
I had to wait for a good 10 minutes while she counted out the nickels
helpfull & extremely friendly
When, after parking your car and entering the bldg.
to wait for an elevator, is there a sign there saying "Parking Area #"?
 We got to the Casino floor before realizing we hadn't taken note of where we had parked and had to go back down.
Perhaps there is a sign next to the elevator ad we missed it.
View royal is the only casino we play at that we never get much play time and never ever leave with more than we came with!
I didn't interact with any of the staff.
I was only in the casino for a short time after visiting the nearby Night Market

I rated cleanliness too high.
I don't think that the machines are kept clean.
I NEVER see them being wiped down after use!
I also think that fountain pop should be offered free.
It was great expirience good service
would have liked a tea  did not see anyone
need more variety on the restaurant menu.
I would like the name returned to red Robinson theatre - what an insult to him -
I would like to more coffee carts around .I spent 3 hours there and never received a cup of coffee.
I think I paid enough to served at least once.I feel your machines are very tight compared to some other casinos.

ones in the United States do pay better.
great staff at your casino...you should be proud to have them working for you...always helpfull and always greet everyone with a smile and a hello
I always enjoy going to Casino Nova Scotia people are friendly and very good service
PLEASE bring back Chicken with avocado at the Trapese.
It's good with fig - but avocado was my favourite.
We miss the Buffet!
But we still enjoy the Trapeeze Restaurant and the food!
I always find the staff to be very helpful & friendly.
Awesome waitress!!
I like that you now have food specials.

not  enough  card  tables--ie.
let  it  ride---texas  shootout---caribbean stud--3  card  poker--4 card  poker
thank  you
the only comment is: I love the River Rock and come as often as possible.
Need more variety of slot games
Great bunch of employees
River Rock is a very good place and I enjoy it.
All staff I have met were knowledgeable and courteous.
If I approach a staff member I always get a friendly smile as well as the help I need!
Not too many smiley happy faces.

The food servers at the Food Court are not at all friendly ...
cashiers' friendliness mostly hit andmiss.
clean the washroom more ofthen
Management should make machines pay better
Really love the people that work here.
There iis one dealer i really dont like and one waitress i dont lile either.
But other than the the people are just amazing.
I see alot of them outside the casino and they always say hey and everything.
It was our first time at the Casino and we enjoyed ourselves.
The meal was excellent in quality and quanity.

Our server was so pleasant that she made you that you wanted to come back which we are.
The coffee servers are excellent.
They actually remember you from one visit to the next
You do not have enough staff on at cashiers.
Always waiting
There is one coffee lady that is outstanding.
I wish I knew her name.
Others are just fair.
I would like to see another eating establishment again.
so another choice is available, though the trapeze is a very friendly place sometimes we go another venue before going to casino, for different choices.

I enjoyed my time there and the reception staff were especially helpful.
None at this time.
Printed cash sheets once for myself and once for my friend were different amounts (lower amounts) than noted on the slot machine.
Had difficulty on some machines putting in security code to get winnings on account.
Slot attendants seem to be a little scarce at times.
Hopefully paying out winners
Don't eat much there anymore as we don't like the burgers.
Go next door to TripleO
Need more current slot machines sometimes there is a long waiting time for games
You never send me any free slot play!!!!!!

lol
Great friendly casino
I find that I can relax and enjoy my paly the slots at Chances.
We ate at the restaurant and did not receive what I asked for.
After several cook errors the waitress was very apologetic and comped our meal.
You need to fix your floors - when people walk by your chair moves and gives you the feeling something is touching you or pushing your chair.
Floors are very unstable throughout.
I would suggest more frequent rounds from the coffee server.
It would've nice if free soft drinks are also provided during the rounds.
Thanks

The main drawback for me is the size of the facility so also the lack of variety of slots.
over all good
They are always cheerful and helpful
nice to have more variety of slot machines......what happened to Jeopardy?
 What happened to wheel of fortune?
 Victoria has more variety of machines.......nanaimo needs more variety
The slots could pay a little better to allow you to play a little longer
The staff are friendly.
It takes forever to get a slot attendant to come when you have either a jackpot or there is something wrong with the terminal in my few experiences at your casino.
I have also heard this complaint from other patrons

thier ok
You should be very proud of your staff.
Very friendly and helpful
Didn't deal with too many staff.
Cashier was okay...security officer at the front dooe greeted us.
Very courteous and friendly staff.
Thank you for the nice stay we may come back with family for our parents 60th anniversary
overworked  short staffed
Some new slot machines once in awhile would be nice.
the best place in b.c  love the 5 cents keno

Need more payouts.
Slits seem to be tighter than it used to be.
most are good but a few are still lacking in training or not working on the right area.
drinks at the bar are too expensive
excellent security staff
The payouts aren't as good as they used to be.
not enough black jack tables...
very dissapointing
I absolutely love all the staff at Chances Dawson Creek.
All departments are very polite and friendly when my husband and I are there.

We feel very comfortable at Chances Dawson Creek.
The ladies washrooms where not clean.
I used both washooms.
I would like an additional 10 dollar coupons because I went there and ALL the slots were malfunctioning.
I like RR but that was really disappointing after a long ride to get there.
All very friendly
We had dinner first and the young lady was excellent
Some supervisors when they are busy get very uptight and have been rude.
I am a little concerned about the number of penny machines that are being replaced with dollar machines.
I also don't think it's right to have a dollar machine between two penny machines - it misleads people and it feels like the casino is trying to pull a fast one on it's customers.

I also don't like how a lot of the favourite old peeny slot machines are being removed and replaced with new dollar machines.
The penny arcade is no longer the penny arcade and you have to be very careful when you sit down due to the changing denominations of the machines.
Had a fantastic time!
They were awesome
I live on Quadra Island & visit Victoria only two or three times a year.
I do not always get a chance to visit View Royal Casino while there.
Thus I am unable to participate in 99% of your contests &/or promotions.
We always feel like we are part of a large family!
 Love it.
The Restaurant could have been better spaced for wheelchair seating and the menu was rather limited.

My only negative really would be the size of the facility.
It is fairly small and cramped and therefore there can't be a lot of choices in slot machines.
Waiter in restaurant was excellent!!!!
I did not have contact with the staff
None.
This was my first visit and was very pleased  and will return and bring some friends
All was fine and I enjoyed myself
Love it so much we travel from courtenay every New Year's Eve...great time.
We stay at the Bastion hotel.
River Rock Casino was a convenient

so wonderful to visit casino nova scotia  when we can afford it
I have always enjoyed going to casino nova Scotia and always look forward to going back.
I have been at other casino's but none compare to my experiences in Halifax.
Just one suggestion is to make the ladies washroom clean every 15 minutes last visit with our friends visiting Vancouver was really dissapointed because of the washroom other than that every thing are excellent in many ways staff are all friendly.
I found the slot attendant who gave me the Reserved sign extremely nice and friendly.
Would like to see more 1 cent machines
Tightest slots ive ever experienced(i may as well just shred my money instead).Coffee service cart frequency is awful.Saw a cart once in 3 hrs and by the time the worker came back(if she did at all) i didnt wanna wait any longer.Slot attendants ignore service lights and turn them off without even checking machine issue!
All in all wont go back
Restaurant staff good at handling lineups and seeing to disability needs.
Good Casino!

nice friendly staff
just really interacted with cashiers.
they were very friendly.
Lighting can be improved.
Add outside heater or rain canopy between parking lot and main entrance 
I always enjoy my visits.
A lot of it has to do with the pleasant friendly staff.
Great fun place
The staff are always very helpful.
Look like you enjoy your job!

As I said before, I cannot say enough good things about the floor staff especially.
The staff are generally very helpful when you can get one to assist you.
Sometimes found Casino to be short-staffed.
We had an extremely long wait for bacon and eggs at the food court.
I know that is unusual.
No special consideration for smokers.
No heat and there are areas that are not even covered so you have to walk in the rain to get to a covered area.
Yet they like to cage you like some animal at a zoo.
Very strange and very inconsiderate of clients.
Vanessa Park was greate .

She went out of her way to make us feel special.
She knew we had a very bad day at the slot machines and she tried her best to make us feel better.
Food in the buffet restaurant is not kept hot enough.
Rooms are way over priced compared to other hotels which are close to the casino such as the Days Inn which is priced at *85.00/night.
All in all the gaming experience was good.
Your food service and food quality could greatly improve.
We had a large group and most of the meals served were ordinary at best.
You could make your casino more of a destination if the food and food service was better.
Instead of serving frozen reheated packaged chicken make something fresh!
There is no reason the food can't equal the gaming experience which from my limited experience was very good.

I don't gamble very often but my wife and I enjoy nights out.
If you provided a better dining experience we would be more inclined to spend more time at your establishment.
no complaints
The staff are excellent people but the amount of people on the floor is most times so sparse a customer is waiting 30 to 45 minutes for an attendant
One night I won a jackpot and waited 40 minutes to be served due to no fault of the staff they were running every where.
There are usually 2 cages open at the front
WHY?
 They staff are extremely helpful but there are so few of them its almost impossible to find them when you need them.
They haven't the time to stop for a moment and sometimes when we are out for an evening we want to say  " Hello" or "How are you today" they can't stop  which creates and atmosphere of exclusion for the patron.
The senior  staff have things under control and it maybe an idea to get their input as to how to improve the atmosphere.

The carpets are very dirty and why so very many machines crammed into such a small space it is no-longer as comfortable as it was and I hear negative comments for a great many patrons " This is not the fun place it used to be"  that is so very true .
Yet the staff that my husband and I have dealt with do their very best to serve us.
I wish I could be more specific but people have the impression that you are trying to drain the last dime out of them for the least amount of out put.
Listen to the chat throughout the casino and you will know things need refreshing in the worst way.
WE haven't been to the Casino there for about 2 years.
At that time, the table staff, overall, was awful.
Complained a lot and made it unenjoyably.
This visit, all the staff was very pleasant!
more new slot machines
the minimum bet is too high

we have always enjoyed  our visit spent at river rock
Did not interact with anyone.
It has been a while since I have dined at Trapeze but I do enjoy the Lobster specials and the Chicken fingers.
can be a long wait when slot attendant is needed
I was in the casino for an hour.
I was not offered coffee or water during my hour of slot play.
Granted I moved machines a bit but had no contact with any staff except the cashier at the food court and main entrance security.
none
The securities in front of the entrance should have smiles on their faces.
They should greet customers when entering the casino

More staff should be posted for slot machine areas.We most of the time cant find a singlr staff nearby the machines.
Generally all are basically very accommodating and courtious.
Staff are a good bunch of individuals
When I visit my mother-in-law in Richmond i enjoy playing at your casino.
I used to be able to spend $20 and have an hour or so worth of entertainment but now they have tightened the machines so tight that it lasts five or ten minutes.
You come out of there broke and depressed and it is just not fun anymore.
I know so many friends that will not even go there anymore at all and am thinking of joining them.
Loosen up Please
I find the service and atmoshere always upbeat and friendly.
I noticed that there has been a marked improvement in the Casino Staff and the washroom cleanliness.

THE STAFF ARE FRIENDLY BUT MY MAIN COMMENT IS I WAITED OVER HALF HOUR FOR SOME ONE TO COME TO  MY SERVICE LIGHT NOT HAPPY
great place always have fun
Food service could be faster.
There seems to be long waits for the simplest things
test
New Year's Eve staff in the bar were under trained and overwhelmed.
Service was very slow and drink mistakes happened often or the wait times was very long and had to ask for our server.
Bands great gambling was good had fun.
Would go back again and hope things have improved as I feel they all learned from that night.
Long line at cashier and they weren't very friendly.

Security at door VERY nice and seemed genuine!
always friendly staff
to small.
Need more slots
we find the dealers very pleasant and  courteous
Sometimes you have to wait a long time for a slot attendant when the machine has a problem
You have excellent friendly staff, I have my favorite who is Marianne.
She always makes us feel so welcome when I bring my mother in.
thanks for your hardwork.
I enjoy  my visits to the casino  .

twice a  week  always smiling faces.
have been visiting for a long time.
Thats my special entertainment.
Not a movie person
More rolette tables
The staff that I have dealt with are great...
I didn't know the machines and the ones I played were paying at a minimal level.
People like to feel that there's some satisfaction in playing ...
guess you have the pay-outs adjusted for minimal rewards .
I WILL not return to your facility

I have found that slots have gone up in price and have found the winnings lower.
Many times I go home losing which I didn't find so often when casino first opened.
We usually go to the U.S.
to play.
We found River Rock the cleanest and most welcoming of the casinos here.
Guest services were exceptional.
If we go to another casino we would consider River Rock in Vancouver.
I didn't interact with staff while at the Hard Rock so cannot provide a comment on their abilities.
I'm finding the pay outs and playing experience is not the same.
Not fun when you can't even play.

The machines keep taking and give NOTHING.
Not impressed.
The only reason we go there is that it's close to home always hoping thins are different the next time.
Very disappointed.
Did not interact.
Waitress have been very good.
Did not eat as a hamberger $12.50 & $3 at A & W.
The staff is always friendly and welcoming right from the security guy at the top of the escalator and straight through the whole casino :)
waits are way too long for attendants to come around they are very scarce.
Some of the dealers could be more friendly.

Pit bosses have been very good.
The slot attendants & cashiers are usually quite busy so I would like to see a ticket cashing machine at the Dawson Creek facility.
It seems to be one of the only casinos that charge for coffee.
Food at the cafeteria could improve.....
Sat at table for two hours before being offered a coffee.
AFter first cup never saw them for another two hours !
Staff spent the entire time I was at the blackjack table speaking to a player in Cantonese.
This alienated all non-Cantonese speaking players at the table and made playing very awkward.
I believe all casino staff should be limited to speaking English at the table if they want to have a conversation so all players can participate.
Would love to see more different slot machines for example like the Gold Miner and progressive slot machines..

I miss some of the old slot machines and try to go to other casinos to play them
I have never had a problem with any of the staff at RiverRock but then ......
I don't ask for much :-)  
looking forward to the new casino on the 23rd
Casino need more parking
Friendly
There is a considerable lack of drink attendants.
 You have to leave the gaming area to go to either the trapeze or the bar for a drink, taking you away from the games.
Generally speaking they are great.
 Every so often you come across someone that just doesn't seem to care about customer service.
 
LOVE IT
no comments
need to have slot ticket payout machines
many don't know answers because there was no need for me to use the attendants.
 didn't win enough.
 the cashiers were very friendly.
i would and will come back 
I have waited quite awhile in the past with my service light on.
I have found the staff to be very friendly.
would like to see more 25 cent slots

It seems like all new casinos get very tight with their prizes.
Why would I come in for $5 free play that comes in the mail.
If I bring 100.00 to play - I would love for it to last a while not 20-30 minutes!!
Not impressed that you took away red robinsons name off the theatre- you could have made an exception - we like him a lot more than the us company hard rock!
Okie experience so far.
Cant complain
Service is slow for slot machines.
Please ad more disability parking stall
Will play overtime i visit the Casino.
Nice place to visit.

Charge for bottle of water was excessive.
It was great - can't wait to go back
I never spoke to any staff member and no staff member approached or spoke to me.
Understaffed at guest services when arriving one person on the desk should've been at least two.
Woman on desk did a great job but there was a big line lined up..
 She asked if we could come back in 10 minutes this was ridiculous.
In Parkade more mirrors should be installed going around corners very tight corners.
More payouts on the slots would be nice.
 every time we've been to the Namaimo casino we hear more pages regarding pages -we seem to do better in Nanaimo than View Royal.
CASINO GAMES ALL OVER NOT IN THE RIGHT ARRANGEMENT TO MY LIKE ING

we did not require service by any attendents so can not comment on their efficencies
It was my first time at Hastings and did not know how to play the races!
Janice was nice enough to sit down with me and teach me!
It was so nice of her!
And I loved to learn it!!
more attendents needed in slot area to fix problems
Just a great place to come to.
Most enjoyable.
Wait times in the restaurant were longer than usual.
There seemed to be a shortage of servers and it was almost an hour from the time we arrived at out table until we got our food.

Good Job
Coffee person could come around more often
slot attendants should not walk in pairs.
then should each start from each end and meet at the center.
that way we don't have to wait so long.
Everytime I come to play the staff is always nice
i went on 3 machines that ask me to call a attended  & when i did no one ever showed on any of those mashines
I really enjoyed my brief visit to River Rock - was impressed with the number of slots available and the feel of the place - could have been in Las Vegas.
 I have already talked to my wife about making plans to come to the hotel and stay-overnight next time we travel through Vancouver.
Very friendly.

Always a great ambiance!
Feel at leisure when there.
the restaurant waiter was excellent!!!
 His name was Steve
I think you should have more attendants around the floor so the customers can find them.
Its hard that you have walk from one end to other to get hold of a attendant for the money change.
And also up date the machine for the money to come out faster not slow.
It takes to long to get the money out for the customers.
The bathrooms are very dirty.
Been to many casinos they are adequate.

 This needs to be fixed to keep me as a customer.
Don - our coffee server - excellent
I took my friend to the brunch for her birthday.
Our service was not very attentive.
I hope the next time will be better.
friendly
some of your coffie servers notfriendly.
keep up the good work
Staff very friendly and helpfull.
The only complaint I have is that chilliwack spice.

It is horrible.
Leaves major after taste.
Will not eat there.
Both meals had this spice and couldn't eat it.
Will think twice before eating there again.
Need more places for a "Quick snack, etc." Send someone to Moncton to see how they run a buffet....successfully.
Friendly staff and cleanliness
the best part of maple ridge chances is the staff very friendly and welcoming.
Great staff!
I loved all the memerobillia.

Security at entrance is always friendly and slot attendants were great.
 Didn't have contact with other staff.
everyone is very couteous
I just don't understand why some people get $5.00 or $10.00 coupons  once in awhile and others don't get a thing..???
I feel that is unfair....
I have been to countless casinos and I have to say that the staff at this location is the most unfriendly and unhelpful that I have encountered.
 The service in the bar/restaurant is slow...I was ignored for about 10 minutes and no one was standing in front of me at the cashier's cage and I was ignored there too as well as at guest services.
 This was not isolated...it has happened to me in the past as well.
 Overall the service in there is absolutely terrible!!
no comemt

the staff at the river rock are the friendliness people i  have meet in a hotel resort casino any were  always a smile how are you good luck all  the time  thank you all
I find the staff both friendly and professional.
 I go often enough that they know my first name or the fact that I am a Mooseheads' fan - they ask me how my team is doing and they comment when they haven't seen me for a while; they always make me and my husband feel welcomed.
I quite enjoyed my time at River Rock Casino but the downside was a negative win!!!!
Let's hope some renos could make it more open and airy with a higher ceiling and better lighting.
All staff are very polite and always make you welcome.
They go out of their way to make you feel like you are part a a big family.
Guest service signage is not good.
I dislike having to go so far into the casino to see them.
 They should be near the entrance.
 
courtesy desk staff being excellent
We always have a super time at Nanaimo Casino.
 Lots of machines and help available
Did not talk to any of your staff members that day and I find the machines  are not as current as the other casinos.
Need more friendly service when serving drinks...
music gets loud after awhile
need more parking
good casino but bclc take is higher than wa.
state casinos so most of my gambling dollars goes south I play same machines In bc and wa returns much  higher in states.
I have found security staff very efficient in giving directions and  a very professional attitude in assisting with customer service.

The line up at the guest information desk can sometimes be long.
If people are checking in their coats there should be a separate line up for this.
Need bar and alcohol allowed.
 Card tables would be good
the staff were great I felt special when i checked in a left - excellent customer service
I'm usually in there with family and we all think people are nice to us.
Jaime in the Buffet is amazing.
She always remembers me and my preferences.
 She goes above and beyond.
Great employee!

Very welcome they take time to have a quick chat  !
I went to Guest Services to question how to obtain a gift certificate that I won for online survey (there was some confusion if it had been sent to Chances in Chilliwack).
The person who waited on me couldn't find the certificate but tried phoning marketing dept (no answer on Friday evening) and even offered to phone Chances in Chilliwack.
 Felt she went above and beyond to try to solve -only wish I had thought to make a note of her name
Poor drink service at the slot machines
nice place
Please have coffee come around more often.
              Thank you
would like to see more penny machines
There is a guy at guest services that is such a pleasant person to deal with.

 I look forward to seeing him every time I go.
 He outs me in a great mood.
We always enjoy the restaurant staff who are fun and fast and  seem to like their jobs.
Friendly staff that we dealt with during our visit to the casino
WHEN WE ARE DOWN THERE FOR DR.
APPTS WE USELY STOP IN FOR A HOUR !!!
WE ENJOY GOING THERE THEN HERE IN NANAIMO !!!
have cheap valet parking for handicapped drivers have a guest service open at both entrances so walking to the other end to enter draws etc isn't so far have a coat check at both entrances have a reduced price at buffet restaurant for early diners
The sushi chef in the buffet was rude to my husband when he used the wrong tongs to pick up a piece of ginger.
He didn't realize they were the wrong ones for that and he apologized and the chef wouldn't let it go.

He was rude to us as guests.
We are from out of town and my husband is an executive chef .
The food was great but he wasn't happy with the incident.
During my time at the casinoI i HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD TIME
If you have not yet done so get rid of the gogo dances - they cheapen the facility.
staff seems like they are grumpy are they think they are better than you and don't seem very friendly  
Not enough disability parking spots by the entrance.
Majority of the time I'm parked by Wendy's and need to go out to move it to another spot so my vehicle doesn't get towed.
There are some slot attendants working at guest services needs to be knowlegable on many things.
They should be helpful at all times to the customers and be friendly to the people visiting at Hastings Racecourse.

Very good and helpful staff.
Wait time for the slot attended is too long  Coffee person hardly shows up hardly see coffee person by the cafeteria
Most of the washrooms are very messy It's very cold in certain areas AC is quite high
Different food choices
Keep up the good work
Need more parking.
 We had to park in Thriftys Parking lot.
See above about how much the Casino has gone down since it was bought a few years back.
A perfect example of "absentee" ownership and not knowing what will work here.
You need to sit down with a small group of 6-12 of us and get some real feedback.

If changes are not made soon I'm afraid the Casino's days are clearly numbered!!
Very pleasant.
Always pleasant
I had to get a new encore card the ONE woman at the desk help others first and then was abrupt; I have NO  idea of her name ; however there was a bartender whose name is Brian and he was excellent some breath of fresh air after standing in a line for service at your service desk for some 20 minutes.
They were helpful when they finally did show up.I was there for 3 hours while my game spun around 1000 free games and I drew more attention from people passing by then the workers on the floor.
Was our first time!
I find it annoying that unattended chairs are not pushed in thus causing elderly patrons difficulty in safely navigated around these obsticles.
Secondly your security staff should engage patron both coming & going from the facilty.
As first point of contact a friendly greeting goes a long way in enhancing patron experience.
I bring a wheel chair with me when I play it is not the best enterence for a wheel chair

Love the new ticket cash out machine - sometimes when bingo is on the cashiers are really busy.
 The cashiers are some of the friendliness of all the casinos we have visited on the lower mainland.
I was annoyed with a few drinkers when I was at the slot machines the last time I was there.
I fell down the stairs.
The customer service attending was very helpful and concerned.
I was ok.
Just missed a step.
Enjoyed the wsop.
had a good time.
Have to say River rock is one Casino I don't win at very often!

Not enough slot attendants on the floor had to wait 15 minutes when my machine broke down and froze could not play or get money out to go elsewhere.
This happens too often as there are not enough attendants
This is the best "Chances" I have been to.
Very relaxing as soon as you get there.
Great to have coffee and food while playing the slots.
More handicapped parking please.
Others can use the parkade!
well run operation
Slot machine selection is poor
Have always found them pleasant and willing to assist in any way possible.

I generally enjoy the atmosphere, and events at Casino Nova Scotia.
 This is the first time I have experienced the rudeness of my previous comment.
 I don't plan to let one bad experience spoil it for me, but if I do ever return to the Trapeze Restaurant, and the waiter is the same as New Years Day, I will request a different sersver.
Signage for cashiers is not adequate as people don't get served in order they are waiting as others walk right in front.
Music when you playing bingo is sometimes annoying
The staff was great - everyone had a smile on their face :)
I feel they should have the  discounts for Seniors...
The food at Trapeze is good but we should have a "special".
 thank you
Each time we go we go for lunch and the young guy with dark curly hair and the blond girl are just excellent.

Many machines are way too loud and need to be quieter.
Guest service person should inform customer what promo that is going at the  moment.
I had to find out myself  that there's a draw every Saturday  night.
I just think that the staff is always there to help you with what ever problem that you may have and always try to get there as soon as possible depending on how busy that it is.
Entrance way poor location and only one Bar areas boring and not very appealing
Always friendly and willing to help.
We stopped at you quick service food area and the cashier that took our order was so friendly and easy to talk to.
Great staff.
I am so glad to see that the cement thing in front of the cars in the main parking garage have colored tape on them so no one else will trip over them.
My husband is still have trouble with his neck from his fall.

He is having to go for therapy.
The outside of the building is ridiculous.
The finishing is horrible.
 It stopped us from going for along time.
The music at night is very loud.
Very pleasant accommodate d
Very helpful and enthusiastic about there job
only disappointment was in the dining area where service was not good and food was only adequate
Not enough working cash machines
parking is very bad

Greatly improved since last survey - friendly and pleasant
keep up the good work
Sometime there is long wait time at the customer service or cashier and for services from slot attendents
Our dealings with Tracey and actually all the front desk personel  (and security greeters at the door) is always friendly and inviting...nice to be welcomed and made to feel appreciated.
The mail out vouchers can improve meaning increasing amounts
the restraunt staff aload two of my guests way over a legal limit for the time perod we were there two beers with there dinners and eight each i understand there stupidity selling beer has a licence
love the location
Brian and Chris in Lulus Lounge are the best!
Rooms are a little pricey.
A certain numbers of your supervisors need to get themselves organized and of course majority of your dealers need to SMILE more and be courteous.

The staff at unlisted were simply the best.
Excellent people there.
Fantastic.
I had a great time and I plan on going again keep up the good work
Have more fun promo like the huge slot machine and coupons for the food centers 
There were never ever enough slot attendants when you needed one
I was only there for a brief time but will be back.
I now live in Halifax and will be attending the casino in the future.
No real contact.
Only person to talk to us was staff member at entrance.

He wished us a great visit.
Very Good.
The Well service was very slow and the server was almost rude.
covered parking is not very safe
Whilst my visit was enjoyable I did not appreciate having to replace my bank card and changing my pin etc.
after using it in one of your ATM's.
need to b e more attentive to slot players needs ie machine issues payouts
Tried to go to Lobster Night at the Tramonto.
 Hostess did not seem very polite or interested since we didn't have reservations.
I just love this place!

Beverage Servers Need To Make More Rounds
I feel that the Casino does not seem to give games for long periods between.
 I feel that somehow it seems that the bidders with big bids seem to win more often...
I feel that when I'm in line at cashier it takes longer then it should.
Not sure if enough staff is on.
The price of your Stella is way to much and it is never cold enough.
I always enjoy going to View Royal Casino and have a good time and good food.
Good
Top managers are excellent a coffee server One of them always sweet and nice
Finding not winning as often.

Used to win more often before.
 Would like to see a change.
Better service for coat  checking.
!.
The front desk staff are very friendly.
Overall, I am always very impressed with CNS staff and their willingness to make my experience a great one.
Great Place, played the slots for a bit then went upstairs for an Italian event it was wonderful :)
I find the staff very friendly & happy to help in any way.
Very pleased.
I like the way Lulu's Lounge is set up on the casino floor.

It is nice to be able to listen to music and dance.
location of guest services could be better
I genuinely like your NEW facility!
 I am very content to visit Maple Ridge's  CHANCES!
 I live in langley and I prefer to travel to your facility.
Great comedy show
Table games with real dealers would be great.
I would like the computerized blackjack table to start at $2 as   the Mission Chances operation does .
   It would draw more people to play and make it more fun for those who find $5 a little high.
   Need more customer services - long line up all the time 
   
It was boring...
Love Alan at Curve Lounge!
He always is cheerful and goes above and beyond without hesitation
All staff very helpful and seem to like their jobs
One guest should only allow 1 slot machine per person.
can't find slot attendant when u needed one.
not enough workers on the floor especially on busy days..
I remember when River Rock first opened and I was very happy that it was fairly close to me.
I enjoy playing there.
you still have the dirtiest washrooms of any BC casino you still three months after I told you have not got hot water in the nw washroom by the food court the cleaning staff obviously avoid going in their because its stinks and is sometime has urine all over the floor I just do not go in there for that reason and I do not want that smell in my cars  carpets  or my carpets at home

Always have a great time in the restaurant because of Mike
The bartender in the lounge was very good.
Poker machines at bar
Please install/reopen  washroom at the west side entrance (near the ATM/$1 slot machines).
Thanks !
at times you may have to  wait to be paid from the slot wins
do great service and the people that welcome you when you come in and out
good casino
I always check before starting to play about any special giveaways etc.
and find that info is sparse.

 this past visit coupons were given out Sat.
for a Spin the Wheeel money draw on Sun.
am.
which was not told to me.
 when I saw others taking part in this and asked the deskclerk about it I was given a chance to take part but felt this could have been made known to me Sat.
night when I initially inquired.
Jaime in your Buffet was one of the best servers we've ever had.
We would come back just to have the pleasure of being served by her again.
Very good was there during machine changing
yes i have fun  and enjoy that day.

To cash a Keno voucher I was directed firstly to two wrong locations before reaching the correct location to have the voucher checked before cashing at the cashier.
First told to go to retail outlet across lobby then to restaurant area and finally to the horse racing establishment above the casino.
We liked the new facility very much in comparison to the old place.
 We were happy with any of the services & will very likely return.
I only go to RiverRock when I have free money to play.
I love those free pops to drink.
The facility is great....don't go often, but when we do we have a good time.
I would presume the staff do what they are paid to do.
casino needs an upgrade.
Starting to look old.

ie new carpets a bit more light needed
More than expected...
no complaints at all...
room staff were so out going and friendly
Beer is very expensive in the casino!
Would be nice if they drink specials!
Cheers
lunch was very tasty
you need more people at reception when contests are going on
signage indicating where you are allowed to consume alcohol not sure if you are able to consume alcohol in the penny slot side or not found it confusing

Not enough slot machines Way too long of waits for the tables
Had an awesome first visit!
Will definitely be coming back again soon :)
Staff is great but often seems not enough there when busy so long waits for service at times but not their fault.
I'm usually there around 11 am - 12pm and I never see anyone on the floor with drinks
Theres no parking available during PNE.
Im still willing to pay for Parking but still a problem.
i  have   a  good  time  when  I am  there
i like it alot
Having the door man a little more friendly and opening the door for you.

some do some don't.
When asked for help on slots sever should stay around till the problem is solved.
The casino entrance is too far from the parking
I always get a warm welcome at the door!
Love that!
Pleasant way to spend a couple of hours
Your restaurant staff are excellent.
 The floor staff are very attentive.
OK
As always the staff in the Trapeze are excellent.

Bigger play area for more slots
Keep up the Good Work.
Tks.
Your buffet is far superior to all the lower mainland casinos.
Want to give kuttos to the manager of Trapeze, had a bad experience with service recently when we went for brunch, it was a extremely busy day however we waited over an hour for food, and when it arrived it was cold, they reordered and the second order was cold as well, the young waiter spent more time talking than he did picking up the orders, the manageress was on top of things and comped the meal as we couldn't eat it.
She represents your organization well.
More disability parking.
Lots of fun!
Used to love it there--now it isn't any fun at all, like I said, up and down/win and lose-still fun!
Now it's always lose,lose,lose--no fun!

Not sure how you could control it but more often than not when I'm leaving people are trying to come in the exit lane even though there are sigs there other than that all is good
Whenever they give out contest ballets when one wins a jackpot on the slot machine sometimes they forget to give it to you.
I think they give more away to their friends and this is not fair.
I like that it has many new games
one diamond members should receive incentives more than twice a year.
i am in a wheelchair and staff is very helpful at door and when i have to use bathroom facility-my wife has to come in so they check for other men in restroom
I would like to see more of restaurant or a buffet all I saw was a sandwich shop
They are freindly
Cashiers are few and far between.
 Slot machine attendants few and far between.
 
 When they reach your machine they are very courteous.
It's a nice place and always very clean..
only small space for dancing in lulu lounge
First smoking should be controlled in the parking lot and the boardwalk to the casino.
  Look at the butts on the ground almost everywhere in the parking lot and boardwalk.
 Not to mention the heavy 2nd hand smoke one must fight through getting from and to the parking lot.
Always a pleasure visiting River Rock
Excellent Casino!
Nil
staff has always been friendly.

i like the more neighbourly feel of this casino compared to some of the larger ones.
i find those too busy and too impersonal.
café prices too high
I was Very disappointed to find only 4-6   slot machines that I was familiar with.
 Almost all others were new.
But improvement was the lit area where my Encore card should go.
 Good!
It's close to home but wish it were a bit bigger with more machines
Had a great time.
 My last visit was special as my girl friend has been quite sick so coming there mad her feel better.
 
 Unfortunately she ended up in the hospital after are visit to river rock & spent 4 days in hospital.
 She is doing great we were talking about spending a night there as soon as her strength is better.
 Really looking forward to it.
 Thank you.
Super friendly guest services staff and dealer
Some games like Sic-Bo that I have played before has been removed.
It's now mainly slot machines and table games.
Got pretty disappointed when some of the other fun non-table games are now removed...
The only thing that I can complain about is that if you are in having a meal you are unable to hear if names are called if you are a winner.
We were in having Dinner one night that you had to be present to win and at 8:10 we realized the name was called and we did  not hear.

Staff are great and very friendly.
Improve table maintenance in the food court.
sometimes waited for a long time for the slot attendants to come.
  So far I  have been very lucky at your casino.
I come by bus from Sechelt each time they are coming there!!!
payout percentages are not great
all very pleasant
All my interactions with staff have been quite satisfactory.
Thank you
would be great to see a self serve beverage area for coffee and tea and WATER

Need more help in the kitchen.
Orders are taken promptly but to long a wait for the food.
One chef is not enough in a restaurant than size.
Good
The staff who come around with beverages should make more trips!
I find your slot machines very tight and not any success at all at coming out ahead.
Always friendly and welcoming.
Happy to answer questions and remain pleasant even in cases where computer problems make customers somewhat impatient.
The ovetsl facilities and service id vrry good.
It is nice to go into a location where you are recognized

Over all you are the very best I've experienced on Vancouver Island !
please arrange a better traffics during the Night Market
I was there on my Birthday
Female server with dark hair has gone out of her way to help me and my wife and we enjoy going back to the restaurant with her serving us.
 Very pleasent and warm when talking to us.
The cashiers and floor staff were very pleasant and happy to assist myself and my wife with our first time being in Chances Chilliwack.
They gave a very clear impression that they were genuinely happy to be there to help us and NOT just because they were being paid to be there.
you have slot attendance?
In the 10 years or so, I've never saw any
would appreciate having the quarter slot machines back !!!!!

It was very hard to leave the parking lot.
I could not find the exit.
  Sign to small
Expand bigger size for more variety of games..like Barcarra
I used to run into my aunt on purpose at the casino to say hi.
 She has oxygen which  she needs to leave at guest services in case she needs it.
 Now the guest service desk is not at the door entrance and in the middle of the building shebcan not go unless she is cinfident she can do it.
 So I say one in four visits at I d say 500 a time  what a loss for you and her
when I returned after my husband passed away, the staff made me feel like I was coming home.
 thank you.
 
especially the tea cart lady, Denise Miller and the floor attendant, Sharon Smajlovic.
they were also very good to my husband.
Received a couple of vouchers for some free play by email however was not able to print.
Why not just put these on my players card
Staff is friendly and helpful
Generally the staffs are friendly and helpful but it seems the number of attendants is not enough.very often we have to wait for a while when we are looking for them.
Sometimes the heat is too much.
Everything's perfect...
dont like that you have to go see a cashier to cash out.
the asino should hve one automatic machine.

line up was horrioble
Love Roberto at guest services!
 Will wait in line longer just to be served by him!
we had a wonderful evening there everyone  was great
    Enjoy Hard Rock Casino always.
More onion rings on side with sandwich.
Rec'd email fr Hardrock on a Tues am and thought it was for free slot tournament contest.
 Checked at guest services and was told it was on Mondays and that it was hot seat draws for free slot play on Tues.
 I was told to sit at a machine and they would be by w/envelop.
 Told them where my friend and I would be sitting and no one came by!
 
 Felt like I had been conned!
 I lost all my $ to boot so that was NOT a good experience.
Need more keno machines
Coffee wagon (at all casinos) needs to be more readily available.
More cocktail servers !!!!
Every one that works there very good an helpful
I find the casino to be very good over all
trapeze needs gluten-free and waiters who know the difference
The friendly staff in your restaurant are wonderful (particularly Karen and Lori).
 They make our dining experience a treat every time we visit.
 
Great.
Very good experience.
More slot attendants available for jackpot pay would be awesome!
 Thank you Nanaimo :)
more handicap parking at the front of casino would be helpful
All the staff were very helpful and friendly
too many 1cent & 2 cent machines.
 Liked older games better like wheel of fortune.
You have a good group in your staff.They always have something pleasant to say-even when you are not on the winning lines !!
a few more machines.

no one at guest service but cashier was friendly and helpful.
   other time cashier was real slow .
redeeming machine would been nice to have around.
was not happy with the fact I was there for 3 hours and only 1 machine gave me a bonus round then it gave me nothing on that bonus please explain why give bonus if you don't get anything for it not to mention chances use to give coupons out be don't do that any more I stopped going to the Kelowna chances for that reason  that is where I live and thought I would give your place a try but I don't think I will be back
Staff is super payouts are extremely tight.
That is why I do not go there very frequently.
For all Casinos I would like to see signs posted in each bathroom stall asking people in all languages to wash their hands after using the facilities.
 So often I see women leaving the bathroom without washing.
 There needs to be signage indicating how germs can be spread.
We were very impressed with our server and the meal provided.

I think the exit should be marked more clearly.
More parking would be an asset
Slot machine attendants should be as prompt as possible
Slots can pay out more for us small time players...
Kim is consistently the top guest services staff member
I always like to enjoy the facilities when we are in town.
you have a different selection of slot machines than we do in Ontario casinos.
 Had a great time will come again.
Sad to see some favorite machines gone.
your staff are very good and well train

I LOVE THIS PLACE!
Everybody is very friendly I actually look forward to talking with your staff and hearing about there trips I think this makes it more personal
players club staff member was pleasantly enhusiastic & bubbly....we left the counter with a smie
I think it is a fantastic casino
Asked  for   directions    back  onto   the    Freeway.
 Very   friendly  and    glad   to   have  helped  us.All  had   smiles   and   very  easy   to   joke  with.
you need more parking we  drove around the building twice and could not find a place to park so we left this was about 1.30
Fun
I couldn't.
Find an ATM THAT DISPENCED.

anything under 100$.
It would have been good to find one that gave under 100$ cash.
Did not have to deal with any staff so unable to rate
The bingo was good but I wpuldn't go there for the slot machines.
It was really hard to find a slot machine to go on.
It was really busy and people were playing two machines.
I don't think htis is fair when there were alot of people waiting to get on the slots.
 Not enough slot machines to accomodate the people.
It was frustrating not being able to get on machines.
Nothing bad to say...

everything is all good...
During my first visit I signed up for the rewards card and was told there would be $5.00 comp downloaded on it.
   This never showed up.
Nanaimo slots seem like they have become rather hard to win on.
I am unsure of what the payout percent is.
Hardly any free games or wins.
More slot machines
The staff at Casino Nova Scotia are wonderful.
I always plan for my visits to the casino..it's my favourite night out!!
 The staff always seem happy to see that I'm happy!
 
sure wish restrooms were cleaned on a regular basis...
Often no hot water in washrooms.
Sometimes no paper to dry hands.
didn't really have time to experience all services as we were only there for just over an hour :)
The only issue I might have is with the coffee cart servers who just don't seem to make the rounds very often and when they do they go past you so quietly that you do not get a chance to ask for a beverage.
 It would be useful if they would at least try to announce themselves in some way so that the customer could be ready to ask for a beverage and have a tip in hand when being served by them.
I really hate it when you get a free spin snd it pays nothing.
I feel welcome as soon as I step through the door of the casino!
I always enjoy my visits.
 Ambience and lighting is superior.
 
Staff r enjoyable.
Birthday events r fun.
Enjoyed my time but not from the area so only come once in a while.
Great casino!
 Has a Vegas like atmosphere!
Need more  machines u don't need all that space in the well
We had fun and the staff we encountered were very nice !
they are great people
Everryone is always very nice
Received excellent from Bar tender "Peter" in Lola's.

Highly recommend him for a staff award if you have one.
We live in the interior but visit Victoria two or three times a year and always visit the Casino
Still too long a wait for slot staff for payouts and reserves.
The buffet & restaurant upstairs is excellant but the one downstairs is lacking in good choice and cleanliness.
Service with a smile
very helpful and friendly
sometimes the wait is too long for: -slot service (eg to request a reserve or to exchange bills that aren't accepted in the machine) -beverage servers
I live in Victoria and we stopped at your Casino on the way to Port Alberni.
 We enjoyed it so much we also stopped on the trip home.
more

Make sure drinks come in timely manner.
I waited over an hour for a drink since server forgot I ofered one.
It's always a fun filled visit.
Very enjoyable and entertaining every time I visit
massage was fantastic at spa
I think for the most part they are very good but I do think they could go around the outside machine a little more frequently
they are all good.
A bit smelly
very professional
Noticed a lower number of "wins" reducing the length of time I can play on my budget.

When I entered Casino Nova Scotia..The lady at the main desk, was VERY patient and kind.
 She was VERY helpful to myself and guests that were with me.
 She explained our promotions and answered all our questions,  making us feel more than welcome
The floor workers are the worst I have ever experienced.
They wonder around not paying attention to service lights.
Stand around lots socializing with each other and security staff ignoring service to the patrons .
Sometimes I get attitude when requesting a reserve sign so I can leave my machine to get n=mere money or step out for a smoke.
New Asylum venue is sometimes too loud when gaming just outside.
Sometimes the air conditioning is too much (too cold).
I think you should provide some complimentary  snacks on the week ends.

 In Sydney on the week-end every hour they provide a hot snack.
 We would play longer if we had something to eat with our  beverages.
Prefer to have cover from Parking Lot to the Casino (against wind and rain)
River rock casino is the best casino I have been in!!!!
Good
Sometimes when I do win it takes awhile for the staff to respond but when they arrive the service is done well
This may seem trivial but I had asked about getting a casino pen as a souvenior as I was visiting from Alberta.
 I could not believe the lady would not give me one - she said they are for birthdays.
 I told her mine is in November and I am never there then.
 Unreal.....
 
asked for a reserved sign and that took quite awhile to fulfil....
I wish you had a Buffet.
They do in the U.S.
& they are excellent.
Have been using Valet parking the last 10 mos.
due to hip surgery and have had great service.
Washrooms are not always as clean as they should be.
Please get more white vinegar for fries at White Spot restaurant.
I bring many friends from the USA and they enjoy it very much.
Always have a great time and lots of fun with staff and patrons.

I miss Crystal Forest and alien cow machine
Guest services attendants are consistently very friendly and helpful.
Security consistently offers a friendly greeting.
The cashier at the confectionary was very good
It would be nice to play bonus rounds more frequently on the slots..
it seems the machines are very tight lately and it does not feel like we have any entertainment value while playing...
no balancing on the paybacks.
I believe parking charges should be credited to your account (upon presentation of your receipt) or at least given a couple of complimentary items as used to be the case.
I have to say that I saw very little of slot attendants...if I wanted to break my money I would have had to go to the cashier.
Usually come when we are in town.

 We live elsewhere though.
Excellent staff....very well trained.
The restaurant has very good food at a reasonable price.
I really enjoyed the specials and date night event.
overall the staff seem to be quite involved in their jobs.
 I notice attendants are very personable but security seem to be mostly in another world.
The folks wiping down machines are generally very pleasant.
I Have limited contact with staff as I play slots for a relatively short period of time
I have not needed their services except at the main desk and they have been very cordial
I went to the cashier cage to turn in my gift cards and received very prompt & courteous service from the young man at the counter

increase number of coffee and drink servers please
At the food court we saw 2 young men leave without paying for food.
They were able to do this because of the way the cashiers are set up.
If there were a turn-style or some way of blocking people from exiting between the 2 cashiers.
We enjoyed the buffet as the servers were all warm and helpful.
The only complaint was our waitress in the coffee shop - she could care less - one of the two (who really was not our initial server) was friendly and helpful.
I especially would like to comment on the service from coffee server Linda.
  She has always be extremely friendly never have I seen her be rude or short.
 Very good service
I have noticed a significant drop in payouts on most of the machines so if they get any tighter I will find another form of entertainment

I always enjoy my visits to the Casino.
 The gal in the restaurant who has been there for 12 years is great.
She friendly and provides excellent service.
Cost to plan gaining up fewer payouts
na
The staff at Maple Ridge's Chances casino I found to be very friendly and helpful
proud of all the people that work on the floor
i find the staff to be great some very funny all ready to help
Guest Services was very slow and a long line up was not pleasant
There seemed to be a shortage of restaurant/lounge staff.

 It took some time to get service.
My visit to view royal was very good
You need more staff in the lounge during large events.
 I watched the World Cup final there & there was one staff for the whole lounge.
You only ask if lighting is good.
But the lights are placed so they reflect off the machines and shines right back in your eyes.
This is poor.
All the machines I liked to play are gone.
Penny Lane has dollar machines.
No longer Penny Lane.

One or two coffee staff are calling out coffee but never look around or listen for people who want coffee.
I see a number of quests chase after them.
I love to come to hard rock i play poker black jack and slots and find it to have the friendliest staff of all the casinos i visit
I have seen friendlier slot attendants at other casinos.
 Not very prompt when service light is on.
 could be waiting a while.
While I'm not big into the gaming I did enjoy it, the entertainment I've always enjoyed at the casino
I enjoy the river rock however do not get to Vancouver that often
My favorite casino and I would go more often.
 My major complaint is shuttle bus could operate every day.
 
 Transit is every hour on saturday and sunday which is very inconvenient for seniors and others.
the staff are very good
service is friendly especially at front desk.
They made me feel like a person and not a dollar sign.
Overall I was very welcomed and felt very relaxed.
Dont like the slot machines at the front of the casino - distracting being right beside the front doors.
Thevlighting in this area is too bright & hard on the eyes.
It is always hot here because they turn the heat up as these machines get drafty right beside the doors.
Should have been a wall here to protect from the elements.
Line ups for cashier has poor signage & direction

Service was very slow in the restaurant.
 Also having the menu change screens made it take longer to make a selection.
I know it's a game of chance but seemed very hard to actually win anything
Alcohol service is very poor.
Embarrassing to show visitors to Vancouver such a no-fun casino.
Vegas does it right.
Follow their example and stop listening to the local whiners in the neighbourhood.
Nothing to add.
Trapeze staff were very nice.
Keep up the good work

I always enjoy my experiences at Nanaimo Casino.
 It is much more enjoyable if I win.
 But everyone says that.
 I don't really encounter many staff members if I don't win.....lol
Loved the atmosphere!
And decor
I used to come to RR every day about 5/6 years ago but now I come only once or twice a year.
The overall ambient has changed downwards and the good feelings aregone
My experience - very poor pay outs on the machines.
 $50.00 disappears and little or no return on your dollar.
 
 Don't mind losing if I get to win once in awhile!
 No fun it seems!
 more fun in the U.S.A.
 other than having to deal with the stale smoke in their Casinos.
Was my first visit and I loved it!!!!
I really enjoy a break from my hectic life and View Royal Casino is the place I like to visit.
bingo is number one game but I see it going down like abbotsford hope not 
most times if slot attendant service is slow it seems it is due to shortage of staff.
I think the slots need to be serviced more often as times when I have been there some do not take your money and some the repeat bet button does not work and there are a lot out of order and if there is a problem the slot attendants take a long time to help you or their solution is try another machine.
other than that all is good.

Not enough new games.
 Same old same old for far too long.
guest services was slow and unorganized
Waiting time for a slot attendant seems to take longer than it should when a payout is to be made
I find everyone in the casino pleasant and very helpful.
 The manager of the restaurant and one of the servers went above and beyond to help me and my wife.
increase the number of popular slot machines
the only issues i notice are the smoking out the entrance is nasty to walk past and i find it kinda dangerous to walk around the parkinglot area
Had a great time during my stay
Make sure rewards card slot reminds you to take card back after use!

This center needs to be a lot bigger as the wait is quite long to get on to some machines every day
we liked it and will return, next time we visit N.S.
more rewards and more payouts on 1 cent machines
As much as I've interacted with staff there, they have been pleasant and courteous.
The casino is a little too far for me to visit regularly .
I find the place is so narrow between the machines I sometimes feel claustraphobic
Didn't like the curtain idea to hide the entertainment area.
 You don't see new games at your casino.
had no report with anyone.
love slots but they have taken the fun away.

Majority of floor staff are really nice people - sometimes the server in the coffee shop could learn some customer service skills - (sorry do not know her name - wears a very long pony tail)
Guest services need to be more welcoming and helpful.
I lost some of my account points recently , probable in the range of $200.00 or more, It would  have been nice to  be notified when points are about to expire.
 You don't receive many points for the amount of $ spent.
so to loose them without notice was very upsetting....
Jodie and Ravi in security always make me feel safe
variety of slots seem outdated.
had a hard time finding any machine I wish to play
Waiting too long for a slot attendant to payout a $330.00 jackpot; should increase to $800.00
Mark handicap bathrooms would be advisable

always very friendly
Great service
When I first starting coming to the casino my winnings were a great incentive   BUT  now I find it a great waste of my hard worked earning just to ever just break even.
 Why have you gotten so cheap.
 I come less and less now until I may not come at all.
I think there should be more machines and more than one of each machine.
Its almost like some times I am not sure If I am welcome.
On the Racing side.
There was a dancer in a kind of cage.
 The music was way too loud and I could have danced better than the girl who was dancing.
 
 And I am 76 years old.
 I thought it was money poorly spent.
regarding people who reserve machines most of the time i am there  couple of hours  tops i have never got a chance to play a certain machine i like .
as it is always reserved if they are allowed to do this they should have some sort of time limit as this is not fair to other people wishing to play.
The casino is fairly small with limited choices.
I visit when I am there.
The keno validation process could be easier - take out the trip to the food court.
I don't like how the floor moves when people are walking by.
I believe that you will be doing some upgrades.
the person at customer service was very nice and helped me more then once that's day for different reasons and he was very friendly.

I like the work that has been done.
It is a bright and welcoming environment.
Other than the cashier, I really had no contact with anyone else.
My wife and I came in played the slots for a bit and left.
Guest services couldn't answer questions about where we could find poker slots.
Coffee person only came by once in 3 1/2 hrs.
$20 glass of wine had sludge in  the bottom of it!
Not a great impression on guests from a different country we had brought down to the casino.
Will think twice before doing that again!!
They made it easy for me to leave my weekend luggage and spend some time in the casino before heading back to Victoria

I am happy with RiverRock Casino staffs near Gaming are.
Always very helpful and courtious
for the questions i answered 'don't know' it's because i never encountered any of those staff members on my visit.
i was there for a few hours.
thanks.
should get more than one cart to serve tea and coffee around the casino floor
the staff is awesome
Staff overall are great some are exceptional
I was a bit disappointed that there was no music in the Harbourfront lounge the three weeks before Christmas.
We like the entertainment in the lounge when we visit.

would be nice if there were more coffee and pop servers available and a little quicker service when you need a reserve to use washroom etc.
thanks
River Rock Casino's staff were awesome!
=] They left a great impression on me!
the men's washroom looked clean but there was an overpowering smell of stale urine.
im a member of river rock casino however i never get any coupon at all!(for5years)im really not happy about it!my friends and families keep getting the coupons but not me!!!!
i hope u guys can hear my from this servey!
N/a
Hard to win easy to go threw 5 0r 6 hundred in a blink of an eye.
The music was way too loud.

I have always had very friendly and effiecient service from the staff at Hard Rock Casino (Boulevard).
 I have been a patron since the doors first opened in our fine city :D
They seem to remember us when ever we return.
Very fun.
Live music sucked too lpud
Could use card tables
I didn't encounter too many staff members but the ones I did were friendly and helpful!
Overall staff are very friendly and easy to talk to
The floor staff and servers were great very pleased the people in the bingo hall witch was wat I was there for were not all that ftiendly I had never been there vefore and it was different then wat I was use to and they just werent very helpful and kinda snotty like I should just no wat im doing and security dident see them at all the whole time I was there there was homeless people coming trying to get free coffee and sitting on the benches whrn I went out for a smoke witch dident make me feel very safe was not impressed at all
I really love the summer when the track is on and you get 2 in one.

 Slots and the track.
I enjoy going to the River Rock.
 It is always a lot of fun.
overall very good venue
I really enjoy going to relax..
 Very satisfied.
We're a please to deal with
the new layout is not very easy to navigate for people with walkers or wheelchairs
had no interactions with staff
Food needs to improve.

the parking when you drive in is okay it is when go to leave the exit its abit confussing
Coffee service inadequate.
Not enough floor staff present
Bring back video blackjack
my out of town guest asked for a pen and the customer service person would not give him one
one of the Bingo callers can not be heard clearly.
 She does not alway pay attention and forgets to give the second number on Hudini bingo.
 She speaks too softly and is hard to hear and understand
I needed a new gold card as mine was lost..The 2 young girls at customer service were very short and on the "rude" side.
I felt as though i had disturbed there conversation.

They were sitting back in there chairs and chatting to each other.(were not busy at all).
Usually when we go to Nanaimo..we can stay and play for awhile..the last couple times..gobbled up our cash and we were out..little disappointing.
We can NEVER get a parking spot either when were there (NEVER)..sometimes we wouldnt stay because of this.
Alot of crazy people outside by the main road ..kind of scary late at night...I hope this casino gets new parking!!
people take advantage of reserving slot machines
the staff are very nice
Thank you very much!
Too much movement and replacement of machines...
when one "finds" a favourite it "seems" to disappear causing one to wonder about looking for it (or them) and then leaving in frustration.
volume on many slot machines too low and / or cannot be adjusted

I can not get soda pop service while playing the slots.
 Every other casino provides it.
 That forces us to gamble at the other casinos more often.
 You also never send me any incentives while you do send them to my wife.
No parking access during events so easier to go elsewhere
Your personal are very respectful and very accommodating.
They are clean and nicely dressed.
There is not enough parking for disabled.
 Had to drop my wife off and then go and find a parking spot and the same when we were ready to leave had to go and get the car while she waited.
 The other spots do not allow the door to open wide enough for the wheelchair or walker.
 
  The waitress forgot our order even when she returned the third time to ask what it was.
She should write it down.
 Two of the plates were wrong when they arrived even after that.
 Automatic door openers would be helpful.
I live in Kamloops or I would visit Chilliwack more often if closer.
Pleaes make the Poker room better!
They are helpful for the most part.
Again I have always found staff to be polite and professional just too few.
Lighting in parking lot seems a bit dim.
Slot area a bit crowded and mazed.

Hope it expands.
Otherwise thanks for opening in this town.
We needed it!
Make slot machines more winning average ...seems to be poorly lately .
your  food  is   still  the  best  in  town   also  great  waitress's
Nice place
Best place ever!
It was so nice and I won in first time ..
I live at down town but I will drive over there again ..
Nice job ..

Was looking for the lucy machine asked an.attendant where it was .
was informed it was no longer here then.i stumbled across it on my own.
the attendant even.checked his sheet for referenece.
staff were very prompt   Went that extra mile to get me a glass of water
The ATM is too far from the smaller slot area.
 Coffee servers are unavailable.
 And unless you have a jackpot win you will never see and attendant walking around
I enjoyed my visit and will continue to spend time there.
 Would recommend you change your survey slightly to include 'didn't drive to casino'.
 Otherwise all questions were good.
 
more of wicked winnings games and more wins would be nice
staff very easy to find
I think someone should be checking the Handicap parking as the car parked next to us when we arrived had no handicapped sign  and we left about 6 hours later that car was still there with no sign.
Does anyone check these spots?
I know there is a lot of handicap parking spots but if you can't get one I guess you go were you can.
Not enough tables.
Especially $5 Blackjack tables.
Not enough drink attendants for tables.
Impossible to get a drink.
Great dealers.

Very knowledgeable.
Please make your survey questions in a larger and clearer type
complimentary drinks (coffee, tea, cokes, etc.) should be offered.
 casino Moncton has this service, which is very convenient.
Very clean and efficient
newer slot games would be nice
Like new games in the slots
I love RiverRock it looks like you are in Vegas !Very Nice place to visit and good time out
the safety factor in the parking area cars racing above at increased speed with no seperation between vehicle and pedistrian traffic and the smell of fumes / gaseous  throughout
There is a lady on the front desk (sorry I don't know her name) who is always welcoming and warm and friendly.

 She always has a little chat with me and wished me good luck.
Not from this province so here only for a short time.
i find the slot attendants are not that friendly  also their response to a slot light going on the need help takes a very long time to get attention
I would like to give special mention to the cashiers.
Having someone these days know your name on siting you is rare.
The cashiers are exceptional in this area.
So to is the Customer service staff.
There really good.
Many persons in front of cashiers for contest  so I could not access cashier to cash a ticket.
No one directing.

when getting into the bonus rounds on the slots you should get some sort of paying because it is so hard to get into the bonus rounds.
There is a couple of bartenders that are lacking in knowledge and have no customer service ability.
I don't gamble very often.
Disco
Washrooms often have paper towels overflowing trash cans.
The ladies in the restaurant are excellent ...always friendly and smiling ..I come there just for lunch sometimes even when I am not playing ...
It was hard to find a slot attendant on the floor but when I did she was very courteous and efficient
Could use more handicapped parking spots
I had a very good experience with the River Rock staff they helped me with all the questions and very helpful
I lost an earring and one staff member at the service desk took me personally to security and phoned over to the poker room inquiring if my earring was found.

 We did not find the earring however.
Very satisfied
Keep up the good work.
I wish your casino had a smoking lounge with tables and chairs in a designated area and not just crammed outside in the parking lot where it is now.
A bit slow at the bar.
Hard to find draft beer unless you go upstairs.
I have only been once so some questions I couldn't answer...need to visit more.
There are too many $1 machines that sit empty while there are line - ups for any of the decent penny or 2 cent machines.
 Seems like a waste of space to me.
Keeping a eye out for people with two or more reserve signs at the same time and playing a third game at the same time!

This women took off and was never spoken to yet.
By in large I find the staff good; especially the ones who run the slot tournaments.
Our experiences at the Hard Rock shop have been great.
Really have enjoyed Steven and his staff
I really find the staff to be very friendly - I enjoy attending the casino because it is a smaller one and the staff actually seem to enjoy their jobs.
Staff always pleasant and helpful.
I am extemely disappointed that the Red Robinson Theatre name was removed - Mr.
Robinson is a Vancouver Icon.
 I would have preferred more of the older type of slot machines.
 Overall  the Casino seemed dark (definitely a change from the way it was set up as The Boulevard) and the layout of the slot machines is confusing.
 
All the staff work hard and are very pleasant.
You should open early just like in Edgewater so we can have coffee at the same time play with slot machines.
Thnx
The cart servers on the floor I feel need to be more assessable.
 I can play for 2 hours without hearing anyone say coffee or pop to get my attention.
Just wish me luck on my next visit!
I don't understand why Victoria does not offer cocktails in the casino just like all the others on the island.
staff is excellent.
i would appreciate  bringing the shuttle back to north van
Overall my experience at RR has been great.

 My last visit at the restaurant for the buffet on Sunday night was not so nice.
 The waitress was very moody because she had to deal with a table where they had no manners and their kids were running around the restaurant.
 She was losing it.
 She was so upset with them and she directed some of that anger to our table.
 Our table consist of my friend and ourself.
The only thing missing is the availability of alcohol drinks in the gaming rooms.
This would be an excellent.
service if provided.
machines were a little crowded!
bigger lunch menu for the WELL

Bar staff very friendly and fast
Really enjoyed my visit to the casino while on vacation there.
I just enjoy going to Casino N S here in Halifax.....
Angela O'Brien, excellant host.
 As a regular slot player for the six months I'm in Canada, Ms O'brien always remembers you're a regular and  stops by to chat re the Casino's services and is a great listener.
They all seem to enjoy their jobs.
We had a server in asylum today that was awful.
We sat with empty drinks for 30 min then decided to go to the bar and get drinks.
When she saw we had drinks she was rude about it.
We settled our bill with her and dealt strictly with the bar after that bad service.

We had to beg to get anything from her.
She would take one drink order and run off before anyone else at the table could order anything.
Very poor service.
Her name(paras)
Available overheight parking would be a bonus.
I frequently get ID'ed while others that look way younger than me walk thru ..
I've be there enough the should remember me like they seem to remember other people..
Hard to get a cocktail and now only 1 bar so you have to walk 1/2 mile to get there
We have found that some of the staff in the restaurant/bar area have either been not very friendly and twice now we were ignored completely
The clerk at guest services was efficient but she wasn't very cheerful!!

none
I would have preferred that Guest Services had directed me to the Cashier when I requested a Slot Voucher as I wanted to submit a voucher for half the amount of the currency on hand.
they are friendly&very courteous
Angela was pleasant and helpful
I find this casino very hard to win anything.
You folks have the tightest machine of any casino I have been in.
 No one minds losing $100 in a fun night but to get it all in 10 minutes is no fun.
 I can play for 3 hours in Lake City Casinos and enjoy the night out but your casino just eats money every time.
 Your cheap in your machines.
  Worst of all casinos.
  
   Your Reno.s are horrible.
  You should have closed for one day instead of this piece meal stupid and it looks trashy.
 Your after the dollar not happy customers - it looks tacky.
I find them very friendly and helpful when I needed one
Had a good time.
will be back.
can be a bit of a wait when you need a slot attendant  can also be very hard to find a coffee server
No comments
the best casino in bc
Some days it's like the slot attendance people are all on a break.waited for 20 minutes to reserve machine so I could go potty.

 No one never came!
Smile more =) win or lose we would feel better if our dealers werent frowning all the time as if they dont want to be there..
So many changes there at the casino its awesome :)
It  was busy and hard to get on machines.
 When I went to cashier there was a really long line and ladies were somewhat quick and efficient but not friendly.
as before.
 Give me a call
I would love yo see more of a variety of .25 slot machines.
The staff is always pleasant and smiling
It seems like a lot of the penny machines have been removed and higher ones put in.

I dont play slot machines but think they could be a little more liberal.
I haven't won a thing for years and have "gambled" away to much money and therefore don't stay long at the casino anymore.
 Because I lose my money way to quick I haven't had the opportunity to interact with many other folks at the casino.
The serves - coffee and at the bar are probably the best thing about the casino, they always make me feel welcome.
 If I had one wish, it would be nice if you would bring back the $5 blackjack tables, I'm not particularly excited about the electronic one.
Impressed with Angela, Trevor, Stacey, Allison and Ron....they always make me feel welcome and "important".
when events are on at the pacific coliseum cant park close to casino for its a ten dollar charge so makes parking difficult cause if I am not attending the event why should I pay !
It would be great if there was also hotel accomodations.
takes time and effort to get somebody to assist in the slot machines.
great place

The coffee attendant was really rude and makes me feel because i don't tip that she is not interested in being nice.
I am scared to ask for coffee.
Made my experience bad.
some of your staff  don't use English
Fantastic casino.
 By far my favorite
The only complaint I have is I don't think it's right on busy nights that people are aloud to play machines beside each other...
Sometimes when it's busy it can be hard to find a machine .
Never tell me how many pts are on my card?
Why?

They told me I had $70 on card.
I had 2 $13 meals and then when Iordered a 3rd they said iI had no credit on card?
BS
Went for Sunday morning breakfast.
Arrived at 11:00am.
Our Oder was taken fairly quickly however we waited for coffee for 20 minutes.
That followed by a further wait until 12:00pm when we received our breakfast.
Several tables around us arrived after we did and received their food well before us.
We finally asked for a Manager and after talking to her our food arrived.
The waitress was quite curt.

Only been there once and had a fun time.
 It is a very small facility.
SStaff competent and friendly
Everyone was very friendly and efficient!
most are great
They are always pleasant, helpful and friendly.
The Hard rock Casino is my favorite place to go lively and colourful
Overall, I had a fun gaming experience.
I rated my experience or value for time and money spent as poor as I spent a significant amount of money playing and never really won much back.
The machines seemed to be more "unfriendly" than usual!!

when i answer i dont know it is because i have had no interaction with said employees
I noticed that some people kiss and rub their hands on the slot machine play area.
 It would be good if you had people wiping down the machines when they are not being played.
My over all experience was excellent and the staff were very professional and accomodating.
I am happy and will return this weekend.
A few more winners would be nice.
It baffles my mind that Hastings Casino is so small and yet the staff don't make an effort to make eye contact with my husband and myself when we visit.
Swinomish Casino in Washington State is small and yet just about all the staff have a smile and a "hello" to us when we visit.
They are way busier than Hastings is too.
Security usually say "hello" but that is about the extent of how welcome we feel.

I found it took to long to service a slot machine when it was down.I had to wait over 20 min to get it serviced and thought that was a little to long
We generally come to the casino when we are in town
My name is REA BRAITHWAITE not PEGGY.
You have my email address reab@shaw.ca.
Please correct you data Thank you
They were very friendly and made you feel welcome and to have fun
most seem very friendly
Sometimes it took some time to reach a attendant.
 You should recruit more attendants during busy hours.
the desk staff were very pleasant and helpful...great personalties

Always pleasant to deal with!
Most welcoming :-)
Coffee staff always good.
Some slot attendents excellent others seem only amiable with certain people.
Waiting for attendants at the machine for assistance is bit long.
Can't find one when you need them
I was there on a week day and no floor service seemed available to order a drink - had to ask the coffee/pop server to request bar service.
 Also my friend had a long wait for a payout on a jackpot.
 Everyone was friendly enough the service just seemed slow or non existent.
The reason for not recommending is that I live in Victoria and only travel to the mainland 1-2/year.

I find one of the security men quite unfriendly.
He was also at the old Casino and was unfriendly there too.
I have been going to the Casino for a couple of years now in M.R.
and he rarely greets me or says good-bye...busy or not...quite annoying.
 You have two very tall slim men working there one black one white.
 They are both EXCELLENT!
 The coffee lady seems much happier at the new Casino and is much more polite than she was at the old one.
 Cashiers are always great!
I wish the machines would not be moved around so much.
 It is frustrating trying to find favorites
 
Table games would be nice
We found the staff & facilities very nice.
 We are new to this area but have enjoyed our two visits to your casino.
could loosen up the machines!!!
Pleases have the coffee girl come around more often......that would be lovely
We ended up using  valet parking as we could find the casino parking.
It seems to always take a very long time for service from a cashier.
I don" like the maze lie environment that you have created we usually go in a group and now we have to serve hard to find anybody.
you have a great staff there better keep them.
Definitely notice difference in chance of winning at slots.

 Slim and none.
Wonderful experience!
Attendant at guest services was very pleasant to me .
Get better cooks
They are always efficient and have made me feel comfortable.
Not every experience can be rated as perfect.
...but overall Chances Chilliwack is a fun place
My no 1 casino
more payouts
We were visiting in Vancouver when we went to the HARD ROCK.

 We generally go to the Casino in Nanaimo BC
Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Long wait time for service in restaurant area.
Miss the wizard of oz game and other such group play slots.
The few you have are always full.
Friendly staff!
The parkade could use more signs on the walls that people can see as they leave their stalls so that they don't turn the wrong way and find no exit (with a U-turn required to correct the direction).
more coffee
The women's washrooms very dirty and messy.
enjoy the casino and find it a pleasant place to be

Too many people sitting in chairs watching partner/spouse okay slots.
Shouldn't have to ask or feel intimidated to ask them to step aside if you want a machine especially given the size of the casino
A ticket redemption machine would really speed up cashing out.
Consider to add buffet lunch or dinner for wider variety of food choice instead of set meal that might attract more people to come.
Always greeted at the entrance with a nod ..
 cashiers are very good and knowledgeable.
all is ok  i loos money almost every time i come
I feel that the coat hooks  in the some of the bathroom stalls are far far to high for the average person.
 Would have to be six feet or over.
Other casinos have live bands and entertainment to draw in crowds.

 Maybe if there were celebrity bands coming to Nanaimo casino there will be more customers...just a thought!
very  friendly and accomodating
It would be nice to have a few familiar machines like - Mr.
Cashman ---- the penguins that dance back and forth.
only complaint:  We go upstairs to the horse racing whenever we are there to get a nice cold pint of draft.
 Most of the time we have to wait and wait.
 Usually he has gone downstairs to get someone's food order.
 The only bar tender shouldn't be leaving his station.
First time going to the casino;  staff was all very friendly and knowledgable
I felt like the rock is my home away from home.

Since this is the only lower island casino (Victoria area) in my opinion there should be an auditorium that shows could be featured such as a dine and show item.
 I understand that space is limited but when the new parkade was built there should have been a theatre included.
 I am thinking samples in the lower mainland and the States.
 More people would like that experience here in Victoria too.
Thank you.
   Wanda Wetteland
I have sat and been ignored in the restaurant on two different occasions --seems the the waitress felt it was more important to talk to and butter up a couple of fellows that she either knew or felt they were better tipping prospect than me -even if she would of walked by my table and grunted I wouldn't of sat there like an idiot wondering if I was invisible --not something that is easy to forget
TEST ONLY
I miss some of the games you had at the old casino on 224
Continue the great work!

Although a bit bigger than the previous facility i found the selection of machines to be sub par.
There was multiple duplicate machines and the good ones were being played every time i passed.
We had particularly excellent service in the Black Diamond.
Very good experience.
You need more slot attendants.
perhaps some Name entertainment?
I would like to see more slot coupon offers either by mail or E - Mail.
Really limited choice of slot games and play denominations more expensive than other casinos
Some need more training in how to talk to people.
 Very rude people not all but at least 75 persent
 
greeter was very friendly so was the security staff in the parking lot..
but parking spaces way to tight ..
I have a very small car and had trouble negotiating an end parking spot that wasn't even labelled for small cars only ..
distance rows was the toughest in this spot 
i love go hard rock good people work  
Keep up the good work and don't let it slide.
We went to the Buffet for lunch on Sunday.
We have always loved going there.
This time not so much.
The food was cold.

Very disappointing this past visit.
Service was great to bad the good wasn't.
Sometimes it takes a long time to get a slot attendant.
I would visit this place again when I am down that way.
Bring back the secret seat slot cash coupons,
More variety in the restaurant menu.
 Able to have a drink while playing the slots.
I
Guest services are ALWAYS wonderful and very nice
I really find everyone very friendly and helpful I always have a great time .

Thanks for such good service.
Anna Stewart
would like $ free slot coupons instead 0f  having  on encore card
May have special dress code on some different culture tradition.
The casino in Nanaimo has staff that is always helpful and in particular the cashiers are very friendly.
So much better since Hard Rock took over the Casino!
Your staff members are always very helpful and very friendly.
I don't mind leaving my money behind but I wish the slots would be loosened up a couple more percentage points to at least let me experience the pleasure of playing for awhile.
 Thank You Michael Dean
I was most happy and relieved on a 2;00 a.m.

visit after receiving a $500 cash win, when the floor attendant and manager assured me that a staff person would escort me to the parking lot, if I so desired.
 I am a friend of patrons who had a bad incident in this regard some years back, one of whom is still having repercussions from injury received.
Parking lot needs arrows on the ground and "no entry" at the one ways.
Lots of confusion when a spot is available and driver doesn't know which way to go due to lack of signs.
Especially if English isn't your first language.
Did not like that they took the Phadom of the Opera slot machine out and put a machine that never pays out.
Also to many of the same machines there would be nice to get some of the new slot machine there as well.
long wait to get slot attendent
Entrance  and leaving the River Rock a little hard cause of the night market ....
could be a little brighter for safety ...

It is very frustrating to put 40 dollars in a machine and not get a feature
I don't usually need the services of the staffs .Occasionally I might go to the front desk to get a new Encore card & they were very nice & helpful.
I feel that I have always had a very good experience at View Royal.
 Of course my frequent visits have allowed me to get to know quite a few of the employees and have had nothing but friendly service and nice to be able to just have a nice chat with them.
 Facitlites have always been well presented and clean.
 My only concern I have ever had is being cold later in the evenings - but not many places that I am not cold in!
 You have a great staff.
I did not play blackjack because of the way you deal the cards.
The dealer should have two cards before the dealer plays the players hand.
Your casino the dealer only draws it's second card after all players are done.

I am from Manitoba and they do it the same as your casino which is why I don't play blackjack here either.
I prefer the native casinos and Nevada for blackjack because the dealer has dealt themselves the same amount of cards as the players before play begins.
No concerns.
 Did not have much contact with staff.
more penny slots or just more slots
Thanks to the staff, we had a great time
had a great experience.
It's very  difficultly to have a parking on weekend!
I find all staff very friendey and helpfull I always have a good time Love everything about the River Rock.
You should have something like GrandVilla where you can swipe your card everytime you go there to win something.

we   need  coffee  stations.
A lot of errors with a blackjack dealer
you should loosen up the slots a bit...
impossible to win..
Would be nice if  you could give a longer time to eat dinner and save our slot machine
Last visit I took out of town guest and they thought it was a very nice place.
best staff of any llocal casino  some new sltos would be appreciated
I found the parking cost too high
Customer service white guy age betw 25 to 35 male not friendly 
They were very friendly and on the ball

always have a good time
I would like to see European touch-bet roulette instead of American.
our waiter and waitress went out of their way for us.
OK
quality employees -you are lucky to have them
When I am changing my tickets in the money machines- sometimes they are not in servivce-which is very annoying and  also painfully slow processing my tickets!!!!
Enjoyed the Customer Appreciation Day last week.
The "Deal or No Deal" was fun (even though I was not one of the names called!!)
every time we need help it will take them a long time to respond.
visibility of your staff is so poor.

The Restaurant staff go out of their way to say hello particularly Lynne who always takes time to say hello to my 92 year old Dad and make him feel special.
The servers are also very kind and charming so we look forward to seeing them every week.
Need more slot attendants and coffee ladies - can never get coffee when I want some at the slots and the slot attendants sometimes take forever to help you when service light is on.
Takes too long for slot attendants when you put your service light on
Some of the slot machines are too loud
River Rock Casino is the best place for passing time!
One of the coffee servers is not that friendly to me.
 She is friendly with certain people and talks to them while ignoring me.
 She should change her attitude.
 I think she is very rude.
 
Very unfriendly unknowledgable staff.
Not a welcoming atmosphere from the moment you walk in.
Not greeted not welcomed nothing.
Eddy the bartender and the lounge staff.
I liked the improvements to the facility.
I appreciate the brightness of the place.
I didn't see no coffee carts?
Is there any?
Its nice to be nice ,especially when you are serving the public .A smile doesn't hurt either .If they don't like their job put them somewhere else .They are the front line for the Casino ,remind them of this point !
It is hard to evaluate a casino on one visit.

 I do hope to go back and try again.
I enjoy going to your casino whenever i visit Victoria.
your sea food buffet is the best in the city
They are very good and I expect continuos stay that way
the  staff never or seldom talk to me so I really can't say if they are good or whatever.
 I never win so do not deal with cashiers or eat there so cannot say how they are.
 they ignore you when you walk in the door or are leaving so I never really have anything to do with the staff
The bathrooms are like pig styes
not much interaction when coming in the door
I would enjoy it a lot better if you had games other than slots and bingo..

all staff are exelent
TOO LOUD
We go here for birthdays , etc.
But Friday was not like usual.
Hardly no parking and could not find  the games we play due to holds on seats, etc...
slot machines are too tight.
Casino is Good.
 Reason would not attend more often is proximity to my residence.
Please make the Minimum Bet for Blackjack $5 $10 is way to high!
I am a 92 year old man a bit slow some time and need help there always somebody around to help

Waitress was excellent.
Slot attendants were not attentive at all.
Had service light on for ever on my machine and had two separate attendants walk past without acknowledging.
Finally got service by calling out to attendant after he had walked right by me!
Rosa and Jennifer are very nice people.
experience is ok.
It is fairly small so the availability of slot machines was pretty slim
Slot attendant.
Brandy is always friendly and prompt in giving assistance and always makes us feel welcome
This was my first time ever going into a casino and it was very scary and i felt uneasy about putting my hard earned money inot gambling.

I have enjoyed it when i was there and i really loved the massage chairs that you have set out for the people to use.
That was an excellent massage which I really benefited from.
LOL Very nice environment but for me I felt uneasy going there.
I went with friends who go frequently and they made it fun for me to experience.
than sk and keep up the good work.
Over all my experience  was awesome thank you see you soon
my fruends and i would attend more often if you made lulus larger and more dance friendly.
we go to starlight now because there is lots of seating and large dancefloor.
 we stay the four hours and gamble too.
but at lulus we can't even get.a seat.or dance so many.times we've left and.gone elsewhere.

In general the staff should smile more.
Some staff seem very happy to be at work but quite a few seem less than thrilled to be there.
some floor staff could not explain how a particular game worked -they may need more training or have someone available to answer questions as they arise
Very friendly and helpful
keep up the good work
Everyone is doing there job great.
Courteous and friendly!
This was my first visit and totally impressed
I always enjoy going to Chances Chilliwack!
Staff are always very friendly and willing to assist.

Thank you
staff is friendly and courteous and if they aren't sure of something they go out of their way to get answers     
Floor Staff are very efficient and personable but sometimes difficult  to find when you have a problem.
I gave you feedback about the reason why I attended your Casino and you adjusted the survey to have an OTHER category.
I went to buy gift certificates and then I gambled a bit.
Thanks for adding other.
Sue
I visit once a week and every week is a different experience.
I appreciate being able to sit and play bingo and play slots.
Never feel pressured by staff and always enjoyable experience.

Getting drinks takes along time.
Dealers are friendly but when they first start they dont seem to get enough training and the pit bosses can be rude to them.
always enjoy going to the casino , great staff and great atmosphere  
Payouts are very poor compared to other casinos.
had a good time
The staff was all amazing!
We had such a great time and made some wonderful memories.
love the restaurant especially the Monday prime Rib dinners.
Thankfully they are making more Yorkshire pudding and baked potatoes so they aren't running out like they used to when it was on Sundays.
Wish slot  jackpot payout weren't  so stingy

I live in Langley which is the reason I do not visit more often.
Slot attendants and availability of slot machines dependent on busy times; sometimes cannot get a specific machine or slot attendants are not readily available.
 Also washrooms are constantly dirty.
Took Advantage Of "STEAK & LOBSTER " On MOTHERS DAY ( Which Was My Wifes Birthday ) The Food Was Great Value  
*** But The SERVER In The LISTED / UNLISTED That Sunday Made  It A SPECIAL OCCASION 
**  Which Even Included A Birthday Cake And Candle
I was disappointed with the size of the gaming area.
overall the staff are very good.
 Sometimes the wait time for help is a bit long though
Love visiting the casino and always have a great time.

 I am planning to bring my visitors from Alberta to the casino in the next 2 weeks.
your survey printing was small on my computer
Consider craps or even a craps machine.
I would have yo say if you got that that would be where I go every time.
I seen one at a casino in idaho and that machine was a dollar minimal bet.
i like this place cause it is close but i dont like to pay for parking 
staffs are good but machines slot are not good 
More Keno machines
I used to have a lot more wins per visit on the penny and 2 cent mchines than I have in the last few years
My cousin goes to the Casino in Moncton and gets far more deals on cheap rooms in hotel and senior meal prices on certain Mondays etc .

She seems to get a lot more promos than Casino Nova Scotia .
all staffs are friendly and most of all its a safe place for entertainment.
I am going to river rock casino coz the location is good and a lot of table games I may choose.
Went to pick up my birthday promotion.
Guest services were extremely helpful and upbeat.
Great feeling.
I find the staff very easy to deal with at all times.
I was at the casino for about 1 hour and didn't see the beverage server once.
 I find that frustrating and it happens almost everytime I'm there.
 Not the alcohol server.
 
 I saw her serveral times.
Needs a machine to cash the In And Out to redeem the tickets from the slot machines.
  Menu the "The Well" needs a better menu.
The Slot attendants are fantastic-always friendly to everyone and efficient!!I really value their customer service ethic!!
they did a very good job
your coffee service could be a lot better he is never around....
and never says anything just walks by and if you see him you call otherwise you do with out....
i really find the staff to always be welcoming and friendly
Most of the dearlers and pit staff make the vist a personnel experience taking the time to say Hi and talk.
I am not really agambler only go to entertain myself.

The staff make this a pleasent experience the majority of the time
Chris at Lulu Bar very friendly and attentive bartender.
 Always prompt service and courteous.
Rob coco deb dave and sat are all top shelf customer service experts
Parking is insufficient for the number of people wanting to use the Casino
Need newer games and more variety also need a larger space for more games and more parking
everyone is very warm/friendly
mostly positive
It would be nice if there was a fast food eat in or take out bar.
The restaurant staff is always friendly and prompt.

I live in Courtenay so when I was in Nanaimo last time I only had about 1 hour to play before I had to start for home.
I put my $20.00 in slot machine but sign came on saying door was open.
It was HARD to find staff and the ones who came didn't have any keys.
I couldn't even get my $$ back out so had to wait.Kind of frustrating.Shouldn't all staff have these keys???
The staff at the Nanaimo Casino are always personable.
they always make me feel welcome.
 They are the best that we have encountered on Vancouver Island.
Parking garage is to far from Casino entrance.
You should reverse the reserved parking and customer parking.
I live on the mainland so visitation depends on when I visit

This was an "adventure" that a few of seniors from Spencer Green planned using the transit system.
 We plan to do it again.
 You have a very beautiful and welcoming facility.
 We ate at the international court.
 The White Spot venue was very unfriendly.
alcohol should be allowed on the floor rather than going to bar.
any staff I have dealt with have been great
I  can't  not  think  of  any  now  other  than I  would  have  like  to  see  a  buffet
I really didn't interact with anyone other than Guest services on my most recent visit.
In the past staff have been courteous & helpful.

I have never been offered a beverage on any visit.
I rarely see a beverage cart or a slot attendant myself.
quite impersonal....thought i ws a customer...i am in a minority
I find some of the staff very friendly and some of them not so much.
So depends on who one is dealing with at the time.
All  your staff are very polite and helpful.
Mentioned in gaming table section
Staff are very cordial and pleasant to all patrons
I do have to say that I was not impressed with the morning buffet
Floors are a bit wonky even after a reno.

I stumbled a couple of times on unmarked grade changes.
Dealers look miserable
Staff are great.
Although.
Casino paid parking Sucks.
I should not have to  ask for a pass everytime
Friendly  smiling staff!
Nice 
Some of the Slot Attendants are very good and friendly but there are still some that will not even smile when we ask for a Reserve sign.
I think wait time for hand payouts is slow

Was looking for the Players Club to get a new card and staff escorted me to them
casino was spotless and very friendly staff
better trained severs
The coffee/refreshment person was hardly around in our last visit.
It would have been nice to be served while playing the slots :(
If I were visiting Vancover again I would make a point of stopping off at River Rock.
Made us feel very welcome and that is important to me.
Staff is always very freindly.
In relationship to my "fair" signage rating - we parked in the lot closest to the theatre and thought we could go in that entrance to the casino.
 It was locked and then we had to walk all the way around to the main entrance.
 
 A sign saying no access unless its show time would have been helpful.
I like the fact that you are always getting new slot games that is why I go and I tell people to go their.
 I am from Duncan and like the variety of games you have.
very good 
Casino is too hot
The slot attendant, at times are invisible, meaning if your looking for one there are none around, When your not looking there are more than you can count
MANY of the machines have no sound.
 Part of the enjoyment and excitement is being able to hear when you have won on a spin and it's disappointing how many machines have no sound and when trying the volume 'buttons' most of them do not work.
 I think this should be a priority in making the experience of using the slot machines a better one.
 Thank you.
 
I was not welcomed by anyone upon entry - I saw no security and was never approached with an offer of a beverage.
The guest services needs to be larger and the line up needs to be more defined.
It gets in the way of regular foot traffic trying to get by.
 Love all of the memorabilia.
Enjoy coming to Hastings but parking can be hard depending on other events on the grounds.
Have not visited much this year as often as I used to but my other family members still visits regularly.
The receptionist was really busy and often had a bit of a line up with people needing help and some just wanting to check or pick up their coats.
 It helped when there was two people behind the counter.
Love this place ??
Really like the layout of your casino

You have gotten rid of almost all of the old .25 machines (I think only 4 left) which is what we like to play.
bathrooms need to be attended to more often the service to slots need to be quicker I notice they tend to regulars when all customers are important  
cannot hear anounsments
far better than Cascades as I can never find any slot attendants
Everyone was very friendly and kind.
 A nice experience.
A good bunch of folks
The slot machine pay out is  very very bad
Never once saw a cocktail waitress or coffee server in the 2 hours i was there.
getting very tired of providing the bc govt with all the money it wants instead of fair gaming expireince for the people of BC.

If i am going to lose money i would rather give it to US casinos as they give a far better return for your money.
Never recommend BC casinos to anyone and also advise them to take their hard earned money to the US.
BC gaming is only interested in bleeding you dry.
have to wait too long for service with slot machines[not enough staff]
I love the metro station is right there at the hotel.
I loved going down to the casino after coming home from a night out.
Room was super quiet.
I can't wait to come back and stay.
I was disappointed the sound system for the "Beatles Show".
as for parking i answered dont know because i do not have a car

The restaurant server and floor waitresses were a little slow considering it wasn't very busy.
 The table games staff were quite good
The staff is very friendly but attendants always take a long time to come.
Customer service staff at the front of house are fantastic!
The food is delicious and the staff is extrordinary.
My friend and I aways oke that we may as well hand over our $20.
that we gamble with at the door but it is always worth the money spent.
On occasion we even get to play for 20 minutes (but usually it's 5 to 8).
Either way the food is great and always a good time.
Good

When you have Chinese food it is nice to have Chinese Tea with your meal even if you have to purchase it
I have fun.
The staff is always pleasant and smiling.
more work required in the washrooms
ordered food from restaurant and requested it be delivered.
I had to go back to restaurant and pick up my meal which was cold.
otherwise good service.
I would love it if there was a station where guests can get their own coffee and pop instead of hoping that the server walks by.
Slot machines are terribly tight.
one superviser did not know about slots

Good place - didn't know it existed
 everyone seems very agreeable!
I did not encounter many staff members.
 Possibly an area for this rather than Don't Know would be beneficial.
I live on the Lower Mainland and don't get to Nanaimo often.
 It was enjoyable visiting Casino Nanaimo
not a lot of slots so many people reserve them while playing other machines.
not enough staff.
when you will a jackpot it takes a bit to be paid out.
Me and Bill always have a great time even when we loose and that has alot to do with your staff they are always friendly and make a point to say hi when they see you wayne is awsome and there are a few other staff members that i can not remember thier names at this time but they are always very welcoming always ask how were doing and if we need or want anything we feel like norm off cheers everytime we come in thank you for such a big casino to always making us feel like we just walked into a small neighbourhood pub where everyone knows everyone we have also had good experiences with other regulars and made some friends keep up the great Job.

Melchor in slots Blair and Sean in the pit, Mike and Aaron on the tables were all outstanding
Loosen the slots so that we get SOMETHING back..
 Spin after spin for ZERO does not entice us back..
The staff do their jobs just fine.
Staff that i encountered are very helpful and courteous
I Visit Chances when I am in Maple Ridge  As I go there to visit my sister  thank you  Sandra  Marshall
It was nice to re visit your casino Your Slot didn't pay much in witch was a disapointement because we go in Moncton with the same amount of $ and we win more offen so it's more fun in Moncton ?
I am very pleased that Nanaimo Casino will soon have a gluten free menu.
 It takes a lot of organization in the kitchen area to make sure that it is completely gluten free.
better promos and more liberal slots

Last time I was there have to wait over 20 min at guest service as they are too busy dealing with other signing up encore card and make rest of us wait till they slowly done
We always enjoy visiting CNS!!
:)
pay better when bonus come
Too crowded.
Hardly any room to move.
I have been at the Casino every day for the June Jamboree and have had a GREAT TIME !
There is lots more to do for the rest of the month.
PIT BOSSES COULD BE FRIENDLIER.
A gift card for my birthday

slots could be updated
The staff were very acomadating
None
Looking forward to a larger facility
I very much enjoy my experiences at the Hard Rock.
The facility is superb and the customer service agents outstanding.
Just wish I could win more often ;-)
Most of the staff where great.
The cocktail service was poor.
Not enough people on shift.

Great times all around
Very pleasant atmosphere.
enjoyed
registration was very good
when I am at casino parking is an issue for me.
most times have been at casino can be a long while before get a parking spot.
I love coming to the casino at Hastings
The slot machines at Chilliwack are too tight.
 People have fun when they can get into the free game bonuses and they are hard to come by at all machines.
 I have at times playing for over an hour on one machine and never got into the bonus games.
 
 Make it a bit fun for people with free games and more jackpots.
always seems to be too long a line up at the cashiers.
 Maybe install machines to cash tickets like in other xasinos  or have more than 2 cashiers on at nights
i won a small jackpot and it took forever for attendant to come--also a few months back didnt have good experience with door person and supervisor
My wife and I found the Buffet very disappointing ..This is consistent with every visit ....The food is COLD and sometimes I wonder if it meets HEALTH STANDARDS ..
It is a nice casino
I was there for 3 hours and never saw the coffee girl.
First you eliminated the milk from the coffee area and now you have eliminated the coffee area.
 The least you could do is cover the floor better with the roving coffee wagon.
When slot machine needed adjusting it took approx 7 minutes to get an attendant.

One staff member said she could not use her radio to get assistance but another one said as she was walking thru she would try to find a slit attendant to help me
Staff on the whole are very good and attentive, personable and friendly.
My favorite casino.
Other Could learn a lot casinos by visiting Chances Maple Ridge.
MORE FOOD IN THE CASINO
Since I played machines I did not interact directly with cashiers as I lost my money but I did have a good time and will be back.
have to wait a long time when you put on your service light  for a worker .
maybe just shortstaffed  
always find staff friendly & helpful
All staff are friendly and helpful.

i fully believe there should be more staff on the floor...
I've personally on several occations had to bend my chair over at machine and walk around to find a staff member...and with that been said it is not peak time eg.
Friday or Saturday no  one seems to respond to you pushing the service button.
We visit Victoria as my brother-in-law and family live there and make it a priority to visit your facility.
we feel it is the most comfortable in the province.
not too big yet atmosphere is great and friendliness is far more noticeable than most.
I rarely interact with the staff but when I do they are all quite nice and polite.
I appreciate that they do not interact with me unless I start it.
I'm not there to socialize.
I really did feel the staff went above and beyond to make it a great visit

I have found that the slot attendants don't generally respond very quickly when 'service' button is pressed.
It often seems to me that there are insufficient staff on the floor and a person has to wait far too long to have an attendant come to pay a jackpot or fix a problem.
 I have waited 10  min or more at times.
Also long line up at the cashier.
 With all the money people are spending you would think they could pay more staff
I love the ambience that RR casino  brings to its clientals from the moment  you enter the casino resort .
visa vi the main enterance.
Space for small Rv to park
Friendly with lots of smiles
Staff at guest services in Race Book were excellent.

I had a real fun time at your casino.
We always get excellent service at the Customer Service Desk.
Slow service in restaurant
Wait line at the cashiers was long at my last visit I like that the slot machines are being cleaned
      Always courteous.
One complint last visit was instructing of a new staff member was going on while I was waiting to use the machine.
I finally gave up and moved elsewhere.
The casino needs more video poker machines
bigger payouts
The coffee servers rush through the casino and it is hard to catch up with them when you are at a machine

ALWAYS W GREAT PLACE TO STAY AND ENJOY..
GREAT PEOPLE...
On all of our trips to Halifax, we have spent most of our time at the casino.
 It was our only reason for going there because we don't have a casino in our province.
 I found all the staff excellent and helpful if I had any questions.
 The security are very nice and welcoming people as you enter the building.
 I have a visit planned for the end of May and I'm looking forward to another great visit to your casino.
 I never come home with any winnings, unfortunately, but I thoroughly enjoy playing the slot machines.
the only thing we have ever had to wait for was a handicap parking spot.
  I think you could have more
  
More promotions activity.
Yours are a little bit less.
You just begin the swiping promotion this month.
Live poker tables
Not enough 'EXIT' sign on roof parking area.
exceptional
I had complained once before about the lack of service of the slot attendants and the overpowering loudness of the music in the gaming part of the casino...both of these irratents have been resolved....i noticed on my recent visit !
Thank-you.
I was surprised that they charge for soft drinks when they come around with the cart.
I always feel comfortable and enjoy myself when at view royal casino.

 Staff is great
A shuttle to the local hotels on a regular basis would enhance my visit.
Not having to worry about  parking or having a few drinks and driving back to the hotel would be nice.
Great crew
Theatre attendants very helpful and accommodating and friendly!This trip we went to a show and casino afterwards...
To contribute our donation!
Ha ha !..always fun !
I liked how there were machines that are bit older but i also loved how there were machines that were new and got the chance to try them.
I can't wait for my next trip back!!!!!
every time we go to the casino, there are changes, which is fine.

It would be helpful to customers, if ALL staff could keep that in mind and be willing to help, even if it wasn't part of their job.
your coffee and soft drink server is a jewel and the others I come in contact with have been very helpful and friendly.
The service in the restaurant and the meals are very good.
The crossing from Casino to Restaurant/Car Park poses danger to  drivers and pedestrians.It should be brightly lighted up or some control set up to prevent people from just dashing accross at will!!
more frequent coffee service
Very friendly
resturant very poor no service 
Staff very friendly
I am looking forward to the new facility when it opens later this month.
one or two servers extra on slower nights.

And cashiers to have more of a smile.
Possibly ask so how was your evening..
just this little comment can have a big impact.
Arrived at the casino to play roulette.
Most tables were closed which meant no colours available to buy in.
Obvious staffing issues as pit bosses were dealing during breaks.
No friendly conversation or any recognition by staff whatsoever which is common place at Edgewater.
I was welcomed to the casino with a smile
Staff at the entrances are all very welcoming.
Well I really enjoy taking my father out at least twice a week for dinner the food is excellent and the service is great at the Black Diamond Grill.

The washrooms do smell sometimes.
no
Do not left me leave with less money every time!
:) seriously!
Provide additional handicapped parking spots.
You have excellent staff.
Thanks.
I have found all that I have dealt with very friendly
River Rock is a first-rate casino...
I'm not much into this form of entertainment but enjoy it when I occasionally go & River Rock is the best

Need to have facility for coat/package /bag check.
A larger variety of newer games would be good too.
Didn't have much to do with staff on recent visit.
Cocktail and coffee servers going around more often would be nice.
Only saw one in 2 to 3 hours.
I believe that you should look into fixing the doors in the lady's washroom.
An elderly lady got stuck when the door stuck on her and couldn't let herself out.
The attendance were quick to come to her aid though.
I think that should be looked into.
Took way too long fr.

personnel to appear when jackpot's won!!!
Every one I have met has been very helpful,knowledgeable and pleasant
the are very nice
They are really not that around to notice them.
 When they are around they seem friendly.
The Restaurant/Bar staff are very good - courteous, knowledgeable and friendly - especially Arthur and Angela (Bar).
 The gaming floor staff are good, but perhaps there should be a few more of them.
 The Gaming Floor seems to be a little under-staffed.
slot attendants servers and security personnel are all extremely friendly
No noticeable security in parking lots in evenings.

would like to play the old style .25$ machines.
miss them Staff are very nice and helpful.
The bar is understaffed at times.
The waitresses can't get out on the slot area enough
                                                                           river  River Rock                      River Rock Casino has great ambience and personnel    
tthey are courteous & approachable
More handicap parking
The staff at View Royal Casino are a great group of people!
My only negative comment would be how extremely dismayed I am at the number of good staff members who have been fired over the last couple of years.
very displeased with service in the buffet   short staffed   more interested in busing the table than providing service like drinks and coffee service    Should not have to try and find a server to ask for coffee after out meal

My over all experience's have been okay....
 some of the cashiers have been rude
Slot attendants take a long time to respond even in early morning hours when the crowds are gone.
There should be more slot attendants on the floor at all times
Sure would like to win more often.
They were very polite and friendly
We live in Prince George so only visit when we go to Vancouver.
I do go to the moncton casino and really like the food there but the staff has nothing on the casino halifax staff.
The reason I put poor rating for games and offers is that I am a diamond member and have NEVER receieved a solitary offer on line for anything ---I went to Granville one tim for three nights this summer and get offers all the time--I go to View Royal at least weekly if not twice a week and three diamonds is WORTHLESS---I could sail the Coho and play across the pond -- I am from the U.S.
and stay her six months each year and find the offers and the payouts terrible compared to the states but then again there is no competition so I understand why but I have to say many of my friends no longer go there and hence you should be concerned

We visit the Buffet so much it would be nice to be recognized for our attendance by not having to wait so long in lineups!
Table games
Most of the staff(not all) walk past you with their head in the air as if "this job sucks" ' Most of them don't even acknowledge you.
 I have been to a few casinos in Canada & US.
 Come on--- is this job that stessfull--if so get out
quite happy with your facility
Very relaxing place.
The staff are always excellent.
you must have a great HR dept.
Staff is very friendly and welcoming.

 It's great when they smile and greet you.
A smile and a cheery voice goes a long way.
It was realy very good time and all staff was exenlend
Everyone I've dealt with except for the guy that was standing at the front greeting people as they came in he was really rude in different when I asked him a question and it was like I was bothering him
Thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
Many new and exciting games.
I find the staff at your guest services a little cold.
They do not welcome you.
I understand that they are overwhelmed sometimes but I do feel they could be a little more friendlier.
Also they should be more knowledgeable about what you may get as comps.

I been to Edge Water casino and the guest services truly do a great job.
Didn' really have any contact with the staff.
 Not nearly as welcoming as Cascades.
 We had a coffee server come around twice.
 A lot of young people because of your entertainment.
coffee servers usually unavailable
Wasn't impressed with the slot machines.
  They used to gave much better graphics!
My wife is very happy to attend the casino.
I'm not very lucky there therefore I would like to try other casinos.

Floor attendants under staff..you to wait for so long..
It's always a good time that my wife and I have at your River Rock casino and a good way for a  great time out for some enjoyment.
We are known to some of the staff who recognize us and make special efforts to make us feel welcome.
All of the staff was very accommodating as I was in a wheelchair and they all went over and above the call of duty to make me feel welcome.
I was a companion for my girlfriend who goes to the casino frequently.
would be nice to see coffee servers
Many answers were rated "Don't know" as I had no contact with them or a service I did not use.
slot machines maintained better.
quicker slot attendants.
music in lounge too karaoke like..not full band.

dance floor not dancer friendly.
slots were tight and didnt give goid value for playtime.
first and last visit.
I find the volume of the skyrider slot machines exceptionally loud and annoying near the Quickhit machines ( near the Trapeze ) I (and my mother ) have left before we wanted to because it was so annoying .
They are way too loud .
I WOULD RECOMAND HARD ROCK CASINO ANY TIME AS THE BEST CASINO TO PLAY  ANY GAMES
Keno machine is in a stupid place same as ticket checker.
Lighting on some machines if your short causes glare unable to see screens clearly.
Air conditioning in back room so cold can't play very long.
Improve the restaurant area cleanliness

Thr restaurant staff is awesome
Put in poker slot machines - to choose your cards for poker hands
They should supply complementary soft drinks like the other casinos do not just coffee and tea.
we basically only deal with bar server in the race book area
My friend had a hand pay 450$ when I was there.
And it seemed to be winning around everywhere machines going off with happy sounds winning sounds.
I don't hear that at any other casino lately
I live out of time but really enjoy coming to View Royal Casino whenever I am in Victoria.
All the staff are friendly and courteous.
I've never had any problem with any of them.

very close to my home and friendly people and cozy atmosphere....
Infrequent rounds by cocktail servers on roulette machines
dont like it when have to wait for someone to help or the game m it going crayz at time......but i dont hear who won the $$$$100.
sometime....love to know who it is thanks.
Generally speaking the parking is very good however mt wife and I were there New Years eve and parking took about 15 minutes.
Once inside....it always is a wonderful expireience win or lose
??
very helpful curtoius and willing to answer a question we had about playing cards for organizations
I did not spend much time there and had no interaction with any staff except for the cashier
I really don't have any additional comments.

The staff have always been very courteous to me.
 Perhaps the only thing would be for them to speak at me more - I have a hearing deficit and when you are around the slots it is sometimes very hard to hear what the staff are saying.
n/a
For such a small casino the Chilliwack one provides a reasonable variety however it would still be nice to see more machines like the 100 lions etc.
and some of the older penny machines.
always very pleasant and courtious
Hi I have few suggestions when someone is playng the dollar slot machines there is know cold beverage ever there they all have to ask for it.
T he next 1 is the staff at where u get the money u have to wait in line for a long time and most arent even open.
The last are the slot machines some are to bright and noisy can u turn the sound down please thank you.
The last one is can u make sure that know one is hogging two or three slot machines as thats not very fair at all I have to wait for that person thanks again and keep up the great job.

Customer desk is awkward to get too.
Line ups with only 1 staff.
 Recommend casino access door from uncovered parking.
Buffet experience could be improved.
 Food is mediocre.
a y priced buffetreasonabl             A reasonably priced buffet like Moncton soft drink dispensers on the floor instead of waiting for snack cart or going to bar.
love the breakfast at penny lane and the new contest for the cruise!
We love our visit and feel safe in your friendly environment
When Asylum is operating with a band the curtain being closed helps to limit the sound level on the gaming floor however the "BASS" level tends to make slot players move to an area that is not as loud.
People move away from that area to get away from the high sound level.

At peak times you should have more staff.
The amazing gal that served us lunch and drinks at the bar made our day!!!!
Thankyou
Rod is very friendly and cheerful
always have the best experience
I only visit once in awhile but when I go I  am treated excellent service I will be back
everyone is always very friendly and helpful and just plain nice
The overall loyalty of staff is commendable.
I think as the roadway into Chances that there maybe need for a crosswalk between both parking lots.
 I know there is a light near by but I can see people just running across due to the proximity of the door to the entrance and the secondary parking lot.
 
Staff is always great.
Need to install "cashing in" machines like all other casinos!
I don't like waiting in line for the cashier..:)
Most of my experience has been with guest services and slot attendants and have always been excellent in their desire to assist
The staff were nice friendly and knowledgable.
Did not have to deal with any so that is mostly good
hard to find at times
Could have a few more attendants for the slot machines --tend to have to wait
the concierge was excellent gave great recommendations.
none very nice people

the lunch buffet was excellent
Few more different 1cent machjnes
Went to see Chicago.
The whole experience and slot machines afterwards was a fun time.
Found the staff to be most helpful and very polite.
They are always pleasant to me and recognize me and say hello
One of your consicere members went out of their way to find something a little baby could eat late at night.
 It was fantastic that he went found such a thing for us.
great man you have there working for you
you may need more slot attendants - there were some wait times

I like the ease of access.
Convenient location.
Always cheerful and helpful whenever I need them.
My wife and i are regulars at least once a week for our date night and you guys feel like family when we come there so thank you guys very much and we will see u soon
I think you need new slot games and more of them to avoid line ups.
 We were bored and left without spending our allotted amount last week.
Love the variety of slots!
The staff are great.
I would have liked better food choices in the casino
Keep up the extraordinarily good job!

Excellent staff really enjoy everyone that works their
All the staff are great.
 We dine at the Trapeze often and they treat us royally.
Personnel at reception desk are very helpful and friendly.
The wait time for an attendant to arrive at the slots when the service light is on is sometimes way too long.....not unusual to wait 15 min or more.
 The coffee and beverage carts seem to be non-existent at times or go by so fast you don't have a chance to get their attention.
Lady at guest services extremely accommodating and knowledgeable.
We have been visiting Casino Nova Scotia since it first open.
We find that over the years, the Casino has been giving less and less every year.
i did not interact with anyone

The café staff are excellent and make me want to be in Casino Nanaimo rather than another casino.
The floor staff are always smiling and friendly.
Need bigger percentage on payouts!
I had a very great experience with the security at the front door.
very pleasant conversation
need more coffee service.
 it was at least an hour to an hour and a half in between service.
 way to long
At my last visit we were disappointed by the quality of food.
We had hamburgers /combo with a drink.

There was no flavour to the burger and the fries were too salty.
It was as if they were the leftovers.
This is the second time in the past three weeks I have had this combo.
We thought the quality of homemade burgers would be different than White Spot.
Nick is an excellent attendant and very helpful.
Mellisa is the greatest on the floor and in the restaurant
more slot attendants; give free soft drink
Need more promotions in terms of free play for encore members
 My Husband & I come to the Hard Rock quite often BUT it seems we NEVER COME OUT WINNERS.
WHY?

Require better handicap parking closer to hotel.
used to love buffet but last 2 time went to Trapeze because you no longer had buffet so went to trapeze which was excelent 
Machines should be updated more frequently with new games and better equipment.
Have nickel keno slots
It would obviously be awesome if you could somehow offer better odds all around...
And more slots that have big running jackpots that can be won on smaller bets
answered don't know  because alongside of the 'greeter' at the door saying welcome and goodbye i had no contact with any other staff.
It was very crowded and busy the day we were there.
Washrooms were exceptionally clean - we all commented on it
staff can hardly speak english and are unfriendly and dont know even own promos

Staff were excellent.
The server in the bar on the casino floor was awesome
I really didn't have any contact with staff other than security coming into the casino.
didnt see very many staff
Talked to at least 10 employees  all were very pleasant.
Did not interact with staff during last several visits.
restaurant/bar  i ordered a glass of wine from the bartender and was quite surprised when he automacly took $2.50 tip and placed it in his tip cup
We absolutely miss Tammy the coffee server.
Enjoy the entire staff.
WE HAVE STAYED AT THE RIVER ROCK SEVERAL TIMES  AND FOUND  THE CASINO AND   THE ROOMS VERY NICE AND THE POOL..

BUT IT IS NOW MUCH CHEAPER TO GO ACROSS THE LINE TO STAY  WITH FREE NIGHTS STAYS WE ALMOST ALWAYS GO EVERY MONTH.
I was alone at the buffet.
Server set me at a table for two and seized the second service.
I thought that was rude and overemphasized the fact that I was alone.
the payouts in nanaimo are below outher casinoes i have visited.
Regular patrol of the parking area at night time especially weekend and festival nights are necessary.
You should have an easier way to turn left out of the casino as traffic flow is heavy coming off Hwy 1 as well as along the main road.
They are always eager to help.
Alcohol is over priced.
  A glass of house wine is $8 or $12.
  
  That is far too expensive.
 I now understand why I saw only a couple of people with drinks on the floor.
As mentioned earlier, the only problem I've had is when I press the "service" button on my slot machine, several times, I've timed it to be 10minutes or more before an attendant showed up ...
and that's when it doesn't appear to be overly busy ....
More people to assist.
  You have to wait a long time for attendants
I have always had a good rapport with all or any staff members I have encountered
Very nice staff...very helpful
would like other dining options than just the Trapeze
didn't interact with any so don't really have any suggestions

More drink service availability
I love chances in maple ridge and when my daughter turns 19 in april I will be taking her there :)
Did not have an opportunity to or need to deal with any RRock staff during my recent visit.
felt very relaxed there
Two visits within one week and each time cleaning staff not pleasant at all.
Not enough cashiers at the cage for redeeming tickets.
At the service desk they went beyond service even taking me to the machine and showing me how to operate it.
Very thorough on asking for ID -- my 45 year old boyfriend was asked for it!
They are doing a very good job.
Had a beautiful meal and everyone was very friendly.

The staff at the Food Fair seemed to have problems with taking orders correctly and did not seem to be able to manage a busy crowd.
Our orders were lost and one order was incorrect possibly due to a language barrier.
The manager corrected the lost orders and did refund our money
High quality staff
I answered don't know mainly because I had no interaction at all with the staff
I found the noise level very loud.
30 minute reserves on machines should not be allowed especially on a busy Friday evening.
 It keeps others from playing (paying) for a half hour.
I didn't interact with any besides the coffee girl and the man at the entrance who nods hello
I find staff paying slots and servicing slots either undermanned ,exceptional busy (not sure this is the case) or just slow to react.

Some time it is too cold to be comfortable.
The fact you tea and coffee avail at no charge self serve a bonus.
Overall I like the experience going to your casino
The staff in the cafeteria area were great!
The bartender was not so great when I made a comment on how much a pint of beer cost...then when I was served the beverage it was NOT a pint of beer...it was a GLASS of beer.
She had a disgusted look on her face during our conversation.
I was only telling her my thoughts that the cost of a beer was too high.
She got no tip needless to say.
All are great
Overall staff has been fine.

 Restaurant waiter was good yuck
They seem friendly.
Looking forward to visiting again sometime !!!!!!!!!
Noticed I was new to the experience and came directly over to help.
It is very nice and neat and clean friendly Casino
over all it is the best casino
View Royal is the best
The staff there always make me feel important.
I am treated very well and recognized as a regular customer.
That to me tops everything.

Good customer service goes a long way with me and all staff exceed my expectations every time.
Only one time I have ever had an issue with an employee but that was years ago and thankfully she was an exception!
Love you guys!
Need bigger slot prizes
i did not deal with anyone
I don't like and don't play the new style machines.
I like the old ones which are very few in number these days.
Rarely see coffee cart lucky if we even see her at all in a visit.
By the time you find someone the ice is melted and pop tastes watery.
 Win jackpot twice and both times it took ten minutes plus for an attendant to arrive I had to track someone down.
 
Close the well for more slots.
They seem very friendly and willing to please you.
Every time I visit Victoria and go to View Royal I have a good time....I have never encountered a staff member that was not friendly or accomodating.
I would go more often if there was shuttle bus services.
my suggestion would be to move to bigger location and have more machines and slot tournaments
not that quick to fix a problem with a slot machine
You rock!!
Need new machines that offer more fun and longer play
sat watching horse races no service for food or drinks..
the sign in parking lot are not very good

Great job with promotional campaigns regarding the play and stay with Delta.
would like to see $3.00  black jack tables the same as siler reef in washington state   20 minutes over the border
Rachel was an excellent server at the restaurant.
We went for the new year's day buffet.
Unfortunately it seemed that the staff was overwhelmed.
It seemed that there was not enough staff to properly take care of the number of customers.
It became very unorganized and the staff could not keep up.
The casino was fine but found it to be abit too smal
Staff is excellent
Why is there never any hot water in the washrooms?

Apart from one or two why are the management staff so distant/not friendly.
I had an amazing time!
The staff were extremely friendly and the atmosphere overall was very welcoming and fun.
staff at promotional desk not very friendly at times.
I wish lighting is bit brighter.
they are not friendly or very talkative.
  They just count you in and say HI or Hello.
 Some will add an additional comment but very few.
 Its like you are just a nuisance to them.
Customer service clerks are outstanding

I have been visiting the Casino a lots in the past, however I feel it is more difficult to win.
And if you are lucky and is able to qualify for a price, the lights are flashing (making it a big deal) and it is ending up to be a small price.
Not very exciting!
I think there seem to be less slot attendants recently.
need more slots as improves more like american casinos opportunities also bar services could be little bit quicker services
staff are always very helpful and friendly!!
what i would like to see is cheaper drinks when playing  the slots.
All the staff I was in contact with were very friendly and courteous.
You do not have enough of them.
Finding a staff person when you need them is very difficult.

Other than that , no complaints.
I have always found the staff very helpful and pleasant.
I love the casino in Halifax, always clean and welcoming.
 Love the décor, don't change it.
would like to see card games
Couldn`t stay too long because hubby doesn`t like gambling in Canada compared to Reno
cafeteria was a bit slow and the order of won ton soup with extra won tons.
I got on 3.
my friend got none
usuallly very pleasant and helpful

One server who serves tables is soo slow at bringing drinks.
The casino can have like 2 people  and it takes her like an hour to just come ask for drink orders
I really liked spin the wheel
To provide more lighting
Very friendly, but need more staff on floor for drinks.
Over size parking is not a large area.
My truck is too high for regular parking and i find over size parking has a lot of mini vans etc that can be parked in the regular parking area to free up space.
making it very hard to park and get turned
I love chances it's great to win but its also nice to socialize and meet people
The wine selection by the dance floor is horrible.

 The bartenders are very poor wasn't impressed at all.
You don't even carry water at your main bar.
I was in the poker area with my husband and the staff there is not informative at all.
Welcome your guests answer questions tell them what promos are on like the card that they clip.
Nobody said a thing.
Staff don't go out of their way.
I was there for 6 hours never saw a cocktail waitress had to go to the one bar only that had rude staff but ok wine.
Get some decent wines as your losing customers that want good wine and bottled water that's hard to find.
Make water accessible silver reef gives it out.
very friendly

I was attending the PNE and I always like to stop into Hastings for a few hours on the slots.
The big barricade was a challenge to get into the casino.
It seems like a real challenge to get in there.
parking is the biggest problem and restaurant should be bigger
My experience on my last visit was not as good as usual as Penny Lane and that end of the casino was closed for renovations.
 I am looking forward to it being completed and the prospect of new slots to try.
Also usually enjoy a meal at the Penny Lane and playing Keno so our viist was sadly cut short.
I think you should put $2 dollar machines in and put Wolf Run (dollar machine) in a couple places.
smoking area further from entrance door
Need to offer alcohol on gaming floor

If your are going to compete with other forms of entertainment then you resteraunt facilities needs a major upgrade.
You may have one of the worst areas for dining in all the casino's in the Pacific nornorthwest.
We just returned from a casino tour in Washington - 4 different ones and I would rate View Royal lower than all those that we stayed at.
Will be back
The dealers overall a great lot.
No problems there.
Had dinner in restaurant until 8 then sat at tables ( bets between 20-40 mostly).
Gave encore card when sat down.
About 4 hours later (never changed seats) the pit woman tells me my card not in system by that time early every dealer knew us so ridiculous to say we had not been there.
Had to call in higher mgmt who said they would fix manually but that did not happen on my account.

Moved to another table at that point betting 50-100.
 Doesn't look like that showed up either.
Something wrong with your systems.
Missing many interactive slot machines esp.spider man or beverly hillbillies also - why couldn't I get water on the floor except to buy bottled water - not okay
Not enough slot attendence during weekend night time.
my favorite slot machine is Thai Treasure.
Recent payout rate is very poor compare to used be.
not at this time
We need a nice restaurant again like there was when the casino first opened.
 Serve liquor on the floor.
 
 I am of a demographic that doesn't appreciate the "hard rock" music and noise.
I'm there to gamble ....
not to attend a rock concert atmosphere.
In the Well I have found the servers can be slow an you can see them chatting behind the bar.
More floor staff bringing drinks around and more dealers for table games.
The table selection on a Saturday night with a concert was pathetic.
I lost my ticket in the washroom and the staff who cleans the washroom found it and gave it back to me!
I was so appreciate!
It was last Saturday evening!
Thank you so much!

A male fellow when buying tickets was not very friendly.
 All the ladies were good
July 22 was our anniversary, we intended to go to Fridays, but has changed.
Irene called the restaurant on 24th inquiring whether there had been any problems with fish?
TOTALLY defensive / offensive answers to the point of being RUDE.
She has been to Dr & hospital  overnight still some test results pending.
EATING at the Casino should not be part of the GAMBLE!!!
I have never had a bad experience with the Casino Nanaimo staff.
 They have always been friendly and courteous.
The employee at Guest services was extremely friendly and welcoming.

She made us feel welcomed and at ease for our first visit.
It was a very good first time and soon to be something I will looking forward to coming more often..even if it is just for a snack.
Great place
would like to see water and coffee people more in dollar high limit areas.
I have no idea what VIP parking is.
I have only been into Chances MR and both times enjoyed myself.
Thank You
All the dealers and pit bosses are exceptionally friendly.
 They make you feel they are so happy when you win.
Loved the casino

At guest service the attendant was helpful and informative
I have not visited River Rock for awhile and it was a lot of fun for me for the couple hours I was there.
I have stayed over night a few times before and the beds are awesome in the Hotel.
I had an over all very good experience this time and would love to come again real soon.
We had dinner and the mashed potatoes were cold and they forgot to drain the veggies before they put them onto the plate beside the potato.
(mushie potatoes) I asked for medium steak with a little pink showing and it came well done.
If we hadn't had to wait for 45mins to get to the resturant and then another 35 mins for our dinner I would have sent it back (I was hungrary so ate it)The waitress was very apologetic.
very attractive facility!
I love Casino NS.
If I could go everyday, i would!!

Thank you for having a great place for me to come and enjoy while I am in Halifax.
LOVE THE CASINO IF I COULD ONLY WIN.
No problems with the staff.
   Problems only with the slot machines.
Too Many Parking spots for the handicapped.
No proper monitoring - seen a few patrons cheat.
I found that all the staff I met were very friendly and helpful!
would go more to hastings if we lived closer.
 actually enjoy the experience........
We were there on Mothers Day weekend and did not realize the menu changed in the buffet.

my problem is why can't you provide a coffee machine in the area for people to help themselves instead of waiting for the coffee lady.
 How much one cup will cost the casino.
 Starlight has coffee all day and people love it.
enjoy going to casino
Need more washroom staff on duty.
Would like to see more slots and different ones
very nice décor and smells clean I gamble in states and always smells smoky
Coverage on the floor by slot attendants sometimes  is not prompt.
 Occasionally it does not seem that they check when lights are on above the machines and they have to be verbally called.
Do you have someone that comes around to bring coffee?

If so I never saw them.
I won a hand payout but had to wait for over 10 minutes to get the money.
 The person said that they were busy with a lot of winners that night.
A better varity of slots
The bingo hall should be closed off completely from the casino area in order for the caller to hear paper players yelling bingo.
 The weekend entertainment at 'The Well' gets so incredibly loud that you can't hear the caller and she can't hear you.
 A man was not heard even after yelling 3 times; he finally had to stand up waving his card and shouting bingo many more times in order for the caller to be aware of the bingo.
 In the meantime someone else had a bingo and he ended up sharing the pot when he shouldn't have had to.
 Another improvement could be the lighting and colour of numbers on the boards to be darker so everyone can see them much better.
   The bingo hall is quite nice except it needs to have a privacy wall in order for players to have a much more enjoyable bingo experience.
   
 From what we've gathered this seems to be the number one complaint of the bingo players - noise levels are too disruptive.
  thank you.
The gaming floor was being renovated during my last visit so there wasn't the variety of slot machines as usual - can't wait to see how it will be when finished
Alaways friendly to customers in the facility
The staff do not talk to the guests in there and all have a sour face on as if you see bothering them.
  I will not be back for quite a while
on Christmas day when entering the casino two security/guest service staff where standing there talking to each other and did not welcome me or even wish me a Merry Christmas.
This is the.
Nice place to have an  entertainment time
Had a drink and appy in Lulus twice and there was only one server on and it was busy...

You can never find someone when you need them
Parking garage needs more entrances and exits
I would like to see a more "Blue collar" menue at the Well.
It's a fun place to be
there are some staff very strict on food comb
It is not as good a place to go for a meal and an evening out with the Buffet not open very much.
Waiting time too long to get pays that attendents have to bring to you.
The bartendar in you lounge was awful.
My husband and I had a  disagreement and she tryed to get her boyfriend to beat my husband up and her boyfriends friends..
You need more handicap parking.

Do you need that many spots for taxis in prime spots?
I wish you had some one going around with a coffee cart with soda and coffee.
 noise level very loud
my friend and I met for breakfast to catch up on things since we last met.
 Continued our conversation which playing slots.
 Really enjoying ourselves but were not getting much wins.
We were not winning too much but a slot attendant and a supervisor happened by.
 We jokingly asked them to turn up our win meter.
 They socialized with us for a short while and we even got offered free tickets to the show that day.
 What a kind thoughtful touch.
 
 We were impressed and thats why we enjoy coming there.
I would love some older slot machines such as the ones against the window by the bingo.
Its easy to understand and less technology.
Also there is only 5 of them so it would be amazing if there were a few more.
Was visiting Island so hadly ever visit this casino
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this Casino.
very friendly and helpful people
restuarant servers should be more responsive to customers.
on one occasion we had to wait over 15 mins to be attended..there were only two people at the bar ..not impressed at all.
the redeming factor...the food was good.

asked why we had to wait so long...i'm here now....again no impressed at all.
..also the coffee was cool and i had to go up to the waitress to ask for relacement.not impressed
I found some new slot machines on the last visit.
 This was good!
 We suggest that getting rid of the older tube screens that have poor images would be a priority.
i really enjoy nanaimo casino  even though i go to  the one in victoria but staff and service is better in nanaimo
It would be nice if they fixed the water fountain.
:)
lose a little win a little ...
soup and sandwiches are good but the brown whole grain bread you had before was the best ..

this bread is ugh!!
It was a very pleasurable day at the races & the casin & we will be back many times with family & friends.
What about more 2cent machines or more Quick Pick variety machines
The only comment i would say is that you have the machines set way to tight I don't mind leaving the casino some money but I like to have a little fun first We don't go in nearly as often as we used to and unless it gets better we will go less and less
We specifically went there to celebrate my mothers 70th birthday and we couldn't get into the buffet unbelieivable the line up.
 Then I had a coupon for free slot play from starlight casino and it was not honored shocking as if you take the coupons from your casino they are honored at starlight without question.
 Also they were very rude at the customer service when I said I had used their coupons at starlight and they were honored (competitior s coupon they call it)  they basically said too bad different owner well I say too bad I won't be coming back again each time I try and give this casino a chance I am let down from the food to the service
I do not typically interact with staff....
We are always welcomed by the staff at Chances and they have gotten to know us so it is our first choice for a night out.
Miss Marty though!

during my pending stay on September 8/ Iwas unable totake advantage of my booking with my staff members.
so i offered my room  to another staff member who had doubled up with staff person.
before making this decision i had cleared it with guest services ahead of time by telephone.
Who said all that was required was for the staff member to show up at the front desk with identifcation.
he did so and was denied the room by the front desk who insisted that i had to show up in person  and convey  the room  to the staff member.
lost 600.
on slots no machine was paying all were nickel and diming
very slow customer servis
you need more of a variety of slots.
The young lady in the restaurant was super.

She went out of her way to make our dinner great.
I had a few vouchers that were sent in the mail for slot credit.
I went to Guest Services to have them "cashed out" and the employee gave me the info sheet showing how to do it myself from the slot machine.
I thought this was very odd.
I don't know why the credit couldn't just be added to my card.
It would have saved me a lot of time.
It was annoying to do at the machine itself.
Customer service in the Casino and resort was great!
the charge for taking money out from the atm machines is a bit high..
Everyone always seems very pleasant and ready to help if needed.

Keep up the great work.
The greeters at the door are always very nice.
Last week when I was there I had to find where you could get a glass of water as I did not have any offered in the 3 hours I was at the same machine, near the washrooms.
I was annoyed at the time.
better signage to indicate display cases
you need $5 blackjack tables
please  NO SMOKING in the parking stairwell.
I would feel safer walking to my car if I saw security staff walking in parking lot
should have valet parking at no charge and more handicap parking
Not much room in the horse racing section.

 Wasn't able to play there.
I finally had hot water in the mens washroom to wash my hands!
Overall we have always had very good service in all areas of the Casino, especially like to go there and relax after a stressful visit to our Doctor or our Dentist.
Great American Staffs are very friendly here at Everett location.
 That is the reason for me to visit there when I want to have gambling entertainment.
I visited during the day so had no problems with parking or machines.
courteous.
I think it would be better of you went back to the original way of earning points when playing.
 There are a lot of people like myself that are upset the way it is now.
 We don't get there a lot and don't spend a lot but  it was nice that the points added  up added up and didn't expire.
 
  Two weeks is too short of time period.
It's like we are rewarded for coming to the casino and then you take the points back.
Even in Vegas your earn points at a lot of casinos and the next your go back they are still on your card.
The area in the parking garage - level 2 - entrance to elevator gets really messy with people throwing away coffee into the garbage then it runs all over and dries ugly looking and unsanitary looking.
Not a welcoming site most of the time.
 A quick hose down would keep it nicer looking.
 Only my opinion....no I am not looking for a job !!
bclc should lower the take to 7% rather than 10% less Canadians would cross into us to gamble
a/c and lighting near the cashier office could be improved...a/c is too cold sometimes and have to put on a sweater and the lights tend to flicker off and on...makes it hard for older people to read the cards
better payouts on spins

The guard greeting people as they come is is always very friendly.
We were guests of the casino at the Delta Barrington.
I have never been so  insulted at a hotel.
They asked me for a deposit of 250 dollars  and than needed to inspect the room before we left 
pay out is very slim
In our last 6 Visits didn't win anything on the Slots - should have had at least a couple of fair payouts !!
The minimum bets are too high.
Need 5 dollar bj and roulette.
This is the main reason I prefer Edgewater.
Staff were very welcoming and helpful.

They are very good
The coffee/beverage service is slow ..
the lady does her best but it is a long way from where the restaurant is to the slot floor .
am always treated well at casino I bet fairly high so therefore l lose fairly high.
I recently went and my daughter joined me.she was definitely treated different than I was (not in a good way)
lot's of music:)
Need to be more servers asking if you would like a drink on gaming floor
I had my lite on for over 30 min no one came had to go to washroom wanted machine to be put on hold finally had to leave came back to machine and someone else was on it and they won and you cant say you were busy because there was not many people at the casino
The noise level is to high on most of the machines.
you might privide ear plugs or lower the volume of some of the machines

The only reason that we would not come more often is that we live in Surrey.
we come to eat and sean is the only reason as food isn't that great he makes you feel special  and tries to please you with food suggestions
first visit    will very likely come again when in Nanaimo
Each staff member i met was  courteous and helpful
LIKE THE NEW SLOTS !!Dont know about all the $ machines pennies and 5 cents are more inviting when you are on a limited budget.
Restaurant is wonderful and  the food is awesome.
Great service.
L
I also came for dinner and I thought the food could be better I would pay more if food was good
All the staff are excellent...

Bought a beer and the Bartender was great!
Friendly and conversational 
Staff in luncheon buffet room was excellent....very helpful and courteous!!
overall Casino good.
 Eating facilitys could be better.
improve lighting
Glad we have this new facility in Maple Ridge....no need to out of this community to go to casino now.
Excellent every time I stay ...especially the rooms ...pure comfort !!!!
I really had very little to do with the staff.
 Any vouchers to be cashed was done at the machine and otherwise the cashier and restaurant server were very friendly.
 
you should have free alcohol beverage akinda from 7 to 11 if you put in over 100$ or win over that for that time period on fri and sat eve
have to wait to long for service to come !!!
parking lot could be bigger
We enjoyed our stay at your hotel.
Room was spotlessly clean and ver comfortable - once again a good experience - thank you!
We were not informed that the buffet had been moved to the conference center outside - we were lucky enough to have two employees on the elevator with us on our way to breakfast - they told us of the change.
Since we were there with the TOPS group we stayed in the hotel and found facilities were very good
i don't know about your new facility  but the old one i waited at least 20 min.
to get paid from my win.
i think you only had 1 person on and he was very busy.

relly thats the only complaint that i had.
it was my first time there as i am not from the maple ridge area but if i was i would  play there.
walking between slots crowded
I could not answer the parking lot question because we always valet park.
 Your valets are excellent.
I feel they are doing a good job in dealing with the general public.
Oftentimes very slow response for slot attendant service after the service light is activate.
Sometimes up to ten minutes.
Very efficient once they arrive
I get coupons in the mail and they are always late.

I live in Tofino.
The staff are what make this casino exceptional.
 They always make me feel welcome and attend to my needs promptly and personally.
They have been well trained in customer service and seem genuinely happy.
This is very refreshing !
I always look forward to my visits to Nanaimo casino and usually make it part of my agenda when I'm in town.
It has lots of special memories for me personally.
Thank you.
should check on reserve signs more often
The Staff is Great!

....Our Meal and service was excellent....Really had a fun time at the Nanaimo Casino.
Look forward to my next visit...
serve cocktails on the game floor
Male dancers is odd
I miss some of your games that you deleted .
the only  thing  I have to complain about is last  march 15th I waited in line  to get in   and this other lady  ran after me saying oh  good they reserved my  machines   now I would say  they cannot reserve and me and another man  said that was not fair   the man working  who   did it said we do it all the time I have been going  to complain further but am waiting for this march 15th which is my  birthday and see if it happens again 
I think that there could be more blackjack tables and then I would probably play more often.
Staff are normally very friendly.
Time taken for payouts seems a little excessive, as well as those that serve drinks sometimes don't have the desired selection, resulting in a long wait time (or them not coming back) to get it.
The stools at the slots are not comfortable

Our purpose this time was to go to the Asylum to see Classic Soda featuring Frank Soda.
Thought it a strange that there was a band and a dj both playing.
It did keep the dance floor full.
The odds on the slot machines seem to be higher than other Casinos.
 My friends and I never win anything at the Hard Rock which is different than the others we attend.
 Kind of takes the fun out of the evening.
It was my first time there and the staff showed me around and made me feel welcome!
The staff are always very good.
I am in a motorizd wheelchair and one of the attendants even offered to bring me coffee.
I thought that was so nice.

I would like to see Chances Chilliwack add more slot machines when allowed.
I have never had any difficulty with the staff.
The facilities are cramped and poor however.
sometimes it is difficult to get service at slots.
Several times i have had to go and find an attendant
keep up the good work
The guest counter staff should greet the customer with a smiling face all the time.
Politely with thank you after the service is done.
I have had problems with restaurant staff in the Food Court understanding English.
 (On this past visit and previous visits)  The last few times I have not received what I had ordered but took the plate because it was busy and did not want to wait any longer.
 
 One time (a few months ago) I got so frustated that I left with no food as the cashier had no idea what I was asking for and was too busy to look after me.
 On that occasion I left the casino and went to the Edgewater Casino.
only interaction I had was when I cashed out...never spoke to anyone else
The staff is quite friendly.
The only thing I find strange is it is a beautiful building and seems to come across as a higher end establishment and the serving staff is wearing ugly orange t-shirts.
You would think that they would be wearing dress shirts or nice colored polo (collared) shirts.
Martin is an excellent cleaner.
 He is prompt when cleaning the machines after someone leaves or if they are vacant.
We are in the back cafeteria style area.
 Water was placed in awkward location.
 
 More than one person was threatened to get "bumped" getting by the service line.
 Strange getting "beepers" for food.
 Set up a little disconcerting as well.
 Staff not especially helpful or friendly to "newcomers".
Everyone is always very helpful and friendly.
more wins would be nice
Gaming is for fun and the dealers are bland really just shuffling is not enjoyable.
If I have had a good time I do not mind losing .
I hate it when they are stiff.
It really seems to me if your dealers were happier and comfortable the games would be more filled.

Cocktail and coffee service is almost non existant.
The servers do not make themselves known very well and the managers or dealers should offer to call the service on the players behalf.
It is the small courtesies that bring players back.
they were efficient and nice when my ticket was jammed.
I have a good time at the river rock and enjoy myself thank you.
You need more slot attendants  and clean-up staff.
waiting time for brunch buffet can be improved a little.
waiting for a slot attendant is far far to long.
To see one walking around and checking to see if the attendant light is on is almost non-existence.
They walk right pass the light.

See them in pairs walking around and chitchatting.
The security guards are normally the first one in see in about 15 mins after pushing the light attendant button.
Beverage servers are also few and far between.
Promotions are poor.
Can't wait to go back to NB.
The slots were difficult to win anything on my past visit.
More table service restaurants needed.
Inadequate seating at the buffet.
Cocktail service was extremely slow to non existing on the gaming floor.
Lounge is always over crowded with a long wait to get a seat.

No where to sit down and have a drink.
Kitchen closes too early in the lounge.
Cafeteria food doesn't cut it.
Grand Villa gives monthly coupons for discounts on food and free play  and I gamble more at Hard Rock.
Hard Rock (and River Rock) give no such offers or free play to me
Servers in the Asylum were very slow to give us a menu after being seated.
Nice place to go to for entertainment  and the buffet as well.
Nice theatre.
Lot better than the other big one in burnaby.
Machines are paying not much  still paying some.

Ambience feels like Las Vegas.
My visits are always positive!!!!
I prefer river rock as it has more variety of slot games and you can have a cocktail at the slots
more machines- sometimes there are so many people- so few choices!
Parking is a problem when events are on at the PNE - The casino should have special passes for people that go to the casino only or special parking stickers
I just don't get a casino without table games.
Offer it all or don't.
Plus you were not even ready to open.
Half a food menu.
Really.

Come on.
On my last visit you had a glitch with your machines which would not accept vouchers.
I think that at a time when you have people lining up to cash vouchers you would have more than ONE cashier to handle the long line up of customers.
No one seemed to care how long the lineup was going to get and more than a few people were certainly pissed off including me.
You hired  a great staff please treat them as they treat the clients
The bartender server between 2 and 5 pm was very rude.
 I believe her name was Natalie or Nadine it started with an N?
 Only ordered a beer at the bar and asked for a glass as I then noticed she rolled her eyes and slammed the glass on the counter...not a friendly atmosphere in the bar area.
 This not only happened once it also happend  twice.
 My husband was the one ordering the beer and mentioned the nasty service at the bar.
 
 I do however say that the rest of the staff are friendly...maybe she had a bad day but for us to return will leave a bad impression.
 We both work in customer service for 30 plus years there is no need to roll eyes one must be friendly when it comes to a service facility.
 Thanks for listening.
took a while to enter of info but persevered and did not rush us to get to the next person
maybe not so many  special parking spots and more open for your average guests
Barb is an awesome people person always smiling and friendly.all staff are smiling and that makes me smile even when I am losing.Thank you staff!!
PA system tooooo loud
Staff is extremely friendly
THE SERFIS OF FOOD NO GOOD .
THE BINGO NEVE IN TIME TO START .AND SORT OF WORKER  IN BINGO .WHEN WE WANT TO TALK THE BINGO MANIGER AL THE TIME SAY POEPEL IS SEEK .AND MANY PEPEL THY DOWD COME BACK.

I find the slot machines to be very much 'tighter' than other casinos I have visited in Canada as well as the United States.
The buffet's wait was too long but the food and service was great.
 The entertainment in the bar was fantastic.
 We had a great time overall.
Thank you :)
All staff is very friendly.
I will attend this casino when in Nanaimo.
It is a reasonably good facility for its size but I prefer poker as my game.
none
Cashier's cage understaffed at opening times.

the ladies who work at the front desk area where super friendly.
they seen I was from Quebec so they tried speaking French with me.
I was very impressed.
they are always smiling.
and made me feel comfortable and welcomed
the guy didnt know what the platinum quick pick game was...but did go quick to find out they dont have them.
I like that you have a varsity of pay scale for your slots
Your staff should be more friendly and outgoing  
Excellent service
Staff could be more friendly.

Can always give a smile at least.
Never even got a proper smile or hello from staff.
I would like a middle of the road restaurant some where to go for a nice dinner or lunch.
Sit down and service not cafe and not buffet .
 Sometimes my friends and I would like to go for a nice meal and then play but are not happy with what is served at river rock.
 We end up going out for dinner in Richmond and not going back to the casino
None
carry on the excellent job!
Staff are usually very helpful and friendly
There are not enough coffee pop people

I live on Vancouver Island so I can only visit Chances Chilliwack when I am visiting the area :))
The staff are head and shoulders above those in Las Vegas.
Hostess was friendly.
Hotel stafffriendly enough.
Did not really have any need for the other staff members.
Coffee servers at the casino were not visible while I was playing.
Had to ask floor attendants where I couldfind them.
I guess the casino is big and there were not enough coffee servers late at night.
The one thing I object to is that the parking is a bit far to walk outdoors because I am in my eighties and walking can be difficult.
If it is raining and windy it is uncomfortable to enjoy myself when I finally get to the casino.

 A covered walkway would help.
 I liked it better when I can park in the raceway.
Supervisors are friendly and accommodating
I would like to have a self service coffee bar (with water aside ) so people can get drink when needed.
no need to wait till the coffee girl come by.
Remains smiling.
I use the valet service to park and the staff are prompt and very friendly
Everyone is friendly.
I would like to thank all the staff for making our weekend so great that we are looking forward to the next time we can make another weekend getaway!!
There never seems to be enough waiters around dinner time

Great straff at retail store.
Nice and big  Never feel crammed in
I felt that I waited a long time for a jackpot payout .
 Not enough floor persons  on duty.
The service and friendliness has improved greatly over the past few months
Scott (night club) and Jesse (security) are outstanding.
 They're always courteous, very friendly, and very customer service oriented.
 Sue (restaurant) is great.
 She remembers regular customers and their choices of food and drinks.
 Great and prompt customer service.
 
 Kat (night club server) is also great at customer service.
 Very friendly and personable.
 Remembers regular customers' choice of drinks and preferences.
 Michael (gaming supervisor?) is another outstanding employee.
 Always friendly and respectful of customers.
thx
Staff seem to only want to cater to the Chinese Asians
keep up the good work gals and guys
Very nice and personable
Your staaff in the eating area  are partcularly good .

Helen
i noticed one day that a lady was bleeding from her mouth and spitting into kleenexes at the coffee station.
When she left I told a staff member and I was amazed at how they handled it.
they removed everything and disinfected the area and put out all new cups and sugar and milk and also took the coffee makers away and brought back all new coffee.
I was very impressed that they believed me and took every measure nessecary...
Kudos to your wonderful staff!
No access to a drink / coffee cart while playing.
I saw it once.
Didn't have much interraction with staff but security at front door was polite and greeted us right away.
 Saw slot attendants being friendly with players.
 
I doubt I will return after the rude treatment by your machine clearing staff at 2 am.
cash out and leave the machine
overall excellent but i do find when you need an attendant at the slots sometimes it takes abit longer then what I would like but that's when they are on a paging system>>  
My daughter has special needs and all the staff treat her with respect and understanding.
They go out of their way to promote our enjoyment.
The staff I'm referring to work every Sunday morning.
Would really like a buffet.
 Also a seniors day would be welcome.
I'm confused on how to order food there.
I like it when it's an open kitchen and can see how clean it is and if my order or anyone else's food is handled properly.

Also going to a counter and order the food and we pick it up once it's done or it's brought to the customer via server.
There was like no servers to be seen
I loved it
thank you for such a great gaming experience .
every time i go i always feel welcome and wanted .
prompt service and awsome attitude from all the staff makes for a wonderfull experience
in house contests for us to enter would be nice......
Get more newer machines
I am vey pleased with the service provided by the Coffee servers.
Would be great if they had a roulette table:)

i have always found the staff to be very curteous and they will go out of their way to answer any questions I may have.
 Security is usually very alert and helpful.
need games where you pick prices
Provide dancing opportunity for players
Is it the liquor law that disallows having a drink at the machines.....may not appeal to older gamblers but for younger ones....its a big one
THE HAMBURGERS ARE ALWAYS COLD AND STAFF A MESS
keep the volume on the music down a  bit till later in the evening for the older crowd.
It is very frustrating to see a big line up at the cashier stand and then realize that most of them are occupied with HRC staff.
My sister is coming 0n the23 of  July and I will be taking her there for her first casino visit ever.
Their is only one machine of many favorites  Can never get on it should be a few of the populars Ones so we can play too people will reserve  For hours

Most of the staff are friendly and cheerful.
I don't know whether to take this a compliment or not because they are beginning to greet us by name.
 Maybe we are there often enough.
Staff are not the problem
I enjoy the river rock and go every time i visit richmond
Ross (security) does an amazing job at being security.
He always makes me feel welcome.
Provides a comfortable atmosphere.
Very friendly.
We found the food at the Wells to be expensive for what you got.

e.g.
Lasagne was not served with garlic toast or salad.
other casinos provide soft drinks (including diet or sugar free varieties) free of charge along with coffee or tea.
 When is River Rock going to do so?
Hastings Racecourse is my neighborhood when I grew up so I like to see casino with that reminds me of my childhood n Playland  I didn't know there was a casino there when I was young but it's still in the same neighborhood my fovoriteCasino is Hastings bread for an excitement Casino
nice that you have adequate staff
Just had great experience over all when visiting.
The food is a little pricey.
It would be nice if River Rock offered food specials on certain nights.
I would come more often and probably for lunch or dinner if the casino offered some kind of food specials.

There are several bathroom stall doors that are missing the sliding locks.
 They have been this way for at least several months.
 It is very annoying especially when the washrooms are busy and there are several stalls without the locks.
Came by bus and found it good as usual.
 Will be back
I really enjoyed my day at Maple Ridge Chances as I won over 500.00  dollars.
 So I certainly went away happy.
 I can hardly wait to return.
 I live in Chilliwack now but Maple Ridge is my home town.
  It is no trouble returning to play the slots.
  
 See you soon.
Not enough slot attendants at busy times.
Iwould like to take my husband on his birthday in Feb
friendly and helpful
Our main observation is that the slot machines are turned down so much that your money is gone in minutes.
Only casino in town so when we're here we go.
We were sitting at the small lounge at the backs nd had excellent service there.
SINCE THE HARD ROCK CASINO  OPENED I TRY TO VISIT AS OFTEN AS I CAN<  I LOVE THE NEW RESTURANT FOOD IS FANTISTIC > I ALL I NEED TO WIN
Pleasant & hard-working - always moving
keno outlet staffs are not available on certain days of the week

Last visit I noticed that jammed machines didn't get attendants to service very quickly and I tried to have coffee in two different areas and there was no cream and the counters were dirty so I just gave up!
??
Even when playing the max amount..no winnings...lots of flash & dash on the screen but no credits given..very poor payback compared to slots at View Royal Casino in Victoria.
we had a great time and will be coming back - in December - as we are not local - but everything was great
I think it would be fun if servers walked around with shooters and other products, maybe random door prizes or other contests and mingled a little to make it more lively.
You have very friendly staff
Slot attendants should be increased as the waiting time for a slot attendant to attend to our needs is quite sometime and sometimes I have to leave my seat and go look out for one.
Also security should be provided at the parking lot especially at night so that single ladies would feel safe walking to their cars after midnight.
I would like some new machines
I already made my comments.

More winning percentage will be good.
I think it should have more lighting in the parking lot.
Nice place to hangout having fun
 most casinos never have enough slot attendants
Eddie and Mel are the best
floors are vey springy when people walk behind you .youthink that they keep bumping you .
but all in all we enjoy our visit thank you.
I met the general manager when I was last there and he is a very nice and helpful man.
I appreciated that he took time to go around and talk with the customers!
I dont really like this casino but unfortunatley there is no where else to go.

You really dont have good machines at all.
I wish you would listen it gets worse and worse.
I only come once in a while for a break.
Keep up the good work!
Always very friendly
Not much encounters with staff when playing slots as not winning big jackpots.
:-)
The slot attendants need to pay more attention whe.
You turn you light on for help or a reserve.
 You wait forever and half the time they are just wandering not paying attention.
 
 You also desperately need a machine to cash tickets in with
The womans bathroom is dirty because patrons frequently urinate on the floor etc..
I think regardless of when cashing out bingo tickets slots side should be able to cash out bingo tickets as well
Disabled parking can be a long distance to walk from the front doors.
most things were ok
We had a great time out there.
Mainly we played bingo but did go to the slots during intermissions.
If I had one complaint it was the loud music mixed with the noise of the slots.
At times it was very disturbing because it came across as all distorted noises.
The few dealings I had were very good.

Maybe for attendants on the weekends.
your parking is way to small
When we arrived to Guest Services they were fantastic.
Smiling and ready to serve with great pleasure.
Slot Manager was terrific when we did not understand how to retrieve our credits he showed us step by step how to look for the points.
Thanks to Slots.
All friendly and nice.
Excellent service provided.
Keep the good work.
The customer service person was very welcoming when I was getting my card.

Also I purchased a gift certificate ($100.00) for a friend and the Concierge was very helpful.
Slot machine seem to pay very little when you finally win
Huge line-up for buffet....disappointing.
 Not many restaurant options.
while your Margarita was not very good the server deducted it from our bill even tho I drank it.
I was thirsty!
Manager was quite helpful but the Customer Service agent was remiss in giving us some basic information....cheers
From my experiencing visiting many other casinos especially in the U.S.
I would like to suggest that a better dining setup would be nice.
I find the dining area by the bar too small with too much walk through traffic to the bar and coffee machine and the close proximity to the washrooms is a very uninviting feature.

Thank You
Live 2 hours away so not there as often anymore since my daughter has moved from Victoria.
Slot's staff take too long to acknowledge machine lights.
When you press for assistance at slot machines no one comes.
The Staff I have dealt with seem fine.
better food and service in the restaurant
They are all very nice and attentive
Very friendly
the food was very good
michelle in the restaurant is good...

miss gail the food and beverage manager who recently transferred to dawson creek...
 hope she does well and if talking tell her we miss her ..
Our staff party was the best we have ever had  because of the staff and venue
casino nanaimo's staff has always been most courtious to me and most know me by name as I am a frequent visitor.
It usually takes a very long time to get a slot attendant.
Need More Staff on Weekend...They can only do their Best...
I Would like the casino to open the sloops a bit more.
                                                                          Thank you.
the staff is great...there just doesn't seem to be many slot attendants walking the floor.
 never anyone around when you need them
 
Would appreciate it if more staff in slot areas where more familiar some of the newer machines sometimes it is hard to figure out what or how to play the slot machines  no real instructions on how to pick the buttons  for special buttons on machines next to how many lines to play
There only for a short time.
Took our money real fast!!!
I would say more quickly than any other Chances casinos we have been to.
u guys should get live poker tables yah budy
very pleasant
the selection of games has decreased  -  too many of the same game in a row ex:  sky rider  --  Also seems the games are not paying out as much or as often (someone has tampered with the odds)
they were very good et explaining how the point ststem works thank tou.
any employee I asked a question to  gave me the answer....
could you please smile alittle bit more

I have such a good time there love it!
I don't understand the whole Crown room deal...your privileged guests so to speak.
Their parking places, special room, etc.
As an average Joe, I go in and spend what is large amounts of money relative to my income.
And I believe that I probably come in more than they do...everyone should be treated the same.
I mean really, you have no hotel, so what can you comp people?
It just doesn't make sense to me...but I really don't think anyone reads these things anyhow.
There was nobody around when I was having an issue with the machine I was playing.
Had to walk away
keep smiling

Loved the Pasta dinner!
They're all very polite.
I like it when you walk in the door and there is someone there who is always pleasant.
 The staff and the food in the restaurant are exceptional
Excellent and friendly service and atmosphere.
 Thank you for doing such great job in hosting the guests!
bring down the prices for food....
way too expensive
IT TAKES TOO LONG TO GET A COFFEE AT TIMES........NO ONE AROUND.
It was very busy the night we visited the River Rock and we found it very difficult to  find and play a Buffalo Slot machine as they were all over and all taken.

We asked where to find them and did not receive adequate help as first time visitors to River Rock Casino.
I was disappointed.
staff in a daze dont know much and seem uninterested including floor manager
Washrooms  show come hould be well maintained.
I have not seen any staff in the facilities at any time I have visited  the area.
 I have heard a comment from two women --'this is a 5 star resort- why is it not maintained?
buffet staff were very attentive to your needs.
 excellent service
My husband loves to play PaiGow and will spend hours doing this.
At River Rock he played for the total of about half an hour.

Was on a bus trip; not from BC
I enjoyed slot play for Chinese New year  it was great fun even though I did  not win it was great all the same 
This was our first time to a casino and we got excellent help from the staff regarding our questions on how to play.
Thank you!
The ones I came in contact with were very courteous and pleasant
I had an off line issue with the slot machine I turned on the service light had to wait serveral minutes as I watched attendants walk around the area ignoring me one even walked behind me as I called out to him for help he was almost rude that I had asked him for help.
 Attendant seemed to just like to walk around and talk to regulars that they knew.
 I also had the pleasure of winning a jackpot on the same night as the slot issue I had to wait 15 minutes before an attendant came .
They acknowledged the win got me to sign the form then had to leave to get the cash pay resulting in another 10 minute wait .
 Thought that was unacceptable as my husband had decided to walk around the casino floor only to report back to me attendants we not busy with other guest but walking around appearing to do nothing but wander the floor  I did take advantage of the coat check where I found staff to be extremely courteous and friendly acknowledging me immediately excellent service at guest services    
 
a friend and I went for the prime rib buffet.
Was excellent.
Have already told others.
All the staff I encountered were very friendly and professional.
Loved the Lord of the Rings game nee more like that.
Some of the food portions were disappointingly small
they always have a smile for me thank you ken
More variety of food and and make sure there is enough to serve for the night not running out at 7:30pm already .security guarding int he parkade
Did not meet any of the staff
Cocktail waitresses need to have themed attire

Should buy old subway and put poker tables in their lol:p
hope you could have new slot machines like mix n match or ring bell or triple seven then across with $500 some sort of instant machine with a denomination of $1....thanks
Entrance to parking area could have better signage
Went to jeromes for a meal.
Staff move at a snails pace.
Talk to regulars but don't acknowledge us.
it take forever to get your machine when it runs out of paper.
and forever to get a machine back on line not happy with that at all.
My game went out of service and it took a slot attendant over two hours to fix it
machines are very tight and you are removing all my favourite machines

They responded quickly to help when needed.
They were polite and friendly.
The staff were he best part of the experience.
The reason for playing more in other casino's is that I live in Victoria and play at the View Royal Casino.
staff I asylm is very friendly and efficient
No interaction.
I found some patrons playing more than one machine.
This took place on some of the popular machines.There was no way I could get on.
Staff at the River Rock Casino are excellent.
The only thing I can think of for improving your establishment would be the smokey smell when you park in the parkade and you go into the stairwell.

The stairs area should be cleaned once in a while to get rid of the smokey odour.
Did not have any contact with staff or any reason for contact today.
very nice staff.
I think the gaming facility in Dawson Creek is very nice.
 I will definately stop in the next time I am in Dawson Creek.
no additional comments
The lady at guest services was excellent.
 She was entertaining, comical and very approachable.
 Thank you for the laughs.
polite and friendly

Slot machines are too loud.
 The casino is too dark.
very friendly and informative, nice bright atmosphere !
More newer games that Vegas casinos have
nothing at this time
I do not like the casino since you changed it from the boulevard I seldom go there The lady at the customer services gave me miss information re the slots of cash casino credits and that is the only reason i played at the casino.
 I don not advertise the casino to anyone and never will there are far nicer casinos within my radius of convenient driving.
 I have cut back on my casino trips as the machines do not pay like they used to and are a total black hole to dump your money in.
 I would rather go to a dozen other casinos than yours.
still to tight on pay outs  like all casinos

staff at the food court aren't the best.
I'm also sad that your getting rid of a lot of the older slot machines that I enjoyed so much.
Overall Very Good
Would like to see more of the newest slot machines
last visit my wife and I spent $ 90.00 in an hour with next to nothing in wins from the slots so are not anxious to return any time soon.
We found the Moncton casino much more fun with better food offering and more bang for your buck.
The Well Restaurant is a great space with good food.
Will be back!
My luck wasn't very good but the experience & facilities were very good.
I never really seen anybody other than the door greeter.

Get view royal to authorize alcohol consumption on the floor.
Add a craps table!!
Would like to see machines pay out more.
The staff have always been very helpful when I have needed them.
Adrian the pit boss is one of the most personable I have met.
i always use the valet parking & they are excellent ; always friendly
you guys still need a coat check
Enjoyed playing there and will definitely be back to plat more often
I live in surrey so your casino is the furthest away of all casinos.
I think of River Rock as the best casino but usually end up by going to the closer ones.

Not player friendly.
Inconsistancy with rules.
You should be very proud of all your staff.
They are always friendly and welcoming when I come to play.
Hard to rate this casino fairly because of the construction.
 Would love to go back after construction is complete to get a better more accurate feel.
Live music too loud was playing bingo and yelled bingo and the caller did not hear
Nearly impossible to find a spot to buy a beer!
To be honest with you I enjoyed it more when it was at the old location.There were more penny machines and a lot more games that I like to play.
i have a daughter that is almost totally blind april delcaro and she had a blast because the staff were very nice to her they talked to her on the way in and out of thecasino very pleased with the door people good job

A few more servers on busy nights like Saturday.
Guest services person signing up new members do I couldn't hand my bag and coat in unless I waited 20 minutes or so.
The machine I wanted to use was out of order the whole time I was there.
first trip to a casino in the area so no comparison available.
 we had a fairly good time.
Everyone  is friendly and staff is very good
They always make you feel welcome
Add more restaurant choices.
We enjoy the casino every time we go.
could be more friendly and prompt.

Love the place/great fun and food all helped to be that by the friendly staff
Table game limits too high for pai gow
Find most of the staff very pleasant; sometimes it is awhile for answer lights on machines when a problem arises but I realize there is only so much staff.
Please let your staff smile all the time when dealing with not right customers.
Thank you
I enjoy playing slots at Maple Ridge Chances!
I have no idea how to "play the slots" - is there a staff person who explains how it works i.e.
what does it mean to bet 1 or 2 or more lines and how much money to put down etc.
All very friendly
 Slot machines should pay out more.Idid have a good tine though..Thank you.....
 
tonight April 12 I was very disappointed in the parking because of an event at the ecana center no parking in the front.
Chances customers should have the best parking first.
This has happened in the past too.
I am a musician so I particularly appreciate the décor.
more free play awards  as we are usually not at casinos for the draws that require attendance
bad food prices
Live near starlight casino but Chances  Mapleridge  is much nicer friendlier  and has customer service
I would like to see live casino and online accounts be linked - I would like to have winnings remain on my card to be used online or in person.
Being over 60 I feel the place has changed too much to attract the younger crowd.
The music was screechy and the overall feel was not as welcoming as before.

Loved the smoking area nice little garden.
better area needed for performers
Need new games and more variety and more parking with newer cleaner building and live roulette not machines
Very friendly and welcoming every visit
all are very friendly
It seems sometimes its difficult to win on slot machines..sometimes have better success at edgewater casino which I go time to time...
the liquor prices are better at Edgewater
Most are pleasant but there is at least one who is very sarcastic and not pleasant at all to deal with.
I am referring to a slot machine attendant.
It was a nice visit, made so by friendly staff.

more winners !
It is my faverite place I will go agin
they are very well trained at what they do  Management is to be commended; should keep this up
being in a wheelchair it was a not the easyest way to enter
the parking lot in some areas feels very lonely and isolated.
The slots do not pay well at Hastings.
